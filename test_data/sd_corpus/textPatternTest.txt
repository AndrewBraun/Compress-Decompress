	The Myth of Sysiphus (1942)
	by
	Albert Camus

The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of
a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had
thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than 
futile and hopeless labor.

If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals.
According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the
profession of highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as
to the reasons why he became the futile laborer of the underworld. To begin
with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their
secrets. Egina, the daughter of Esopus, was carried off by Jupiter. The father
was shocked by that disappearance and complained to Sisyphus. He, who
knew of the abduction, offered to tell about it on condition that Esopus
would give water to the citadel of Corinth. To the celestial thunderbolts he
preferred the benediction of water. He was punished for this in the
underworld. Homer tells us also that Sisyphus had put Death in chains. Pluto
could not endure the sight of his deserted, silent empire. He dispatched the
god of war, who liberated Death from the hands of her conqueror.

It is said that Sisyphus, being near to death, rashly wanted to test his wife's
love. He ordered her to cast his unburied body into the middle of the public
square. Sisyphus woke up in the underworld. And there, annoyed by an
obedience so contrary to human love, he obtained from Pluto permission to
return to earth in order to chastise his wife. But when he had seen again the
face of this world, enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea, he no
longer wanted to go back to the infernal darkness. Recalls, signs of anger,
warnings were of no avail. Many years more he lived facing the curve of the
gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of earth. A decree of the gods was
necessary. Mercury came and seized the impudent man by the collar and,
snatching him from his joys, lead him forcibly back to the underworld,
where his rock was ready for him.

You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much
through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred
of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which
the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price
that must be paid for the passions of this earth. Nothing is told us about
Sisyphus in the underworld. Myths are made for the imagination to breathe
life into them. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body
straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred
times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone,
the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh
start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted
hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time
without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the stone
rush down in a few moments toward tlower world whence he will have to
push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain.

It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that
toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back
down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will
never know the end. That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely
as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness. At each of those moments
when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods,
he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.

If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious. Where would his
torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The
workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate
is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes
conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious,
knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of
during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same
time crowns his victory. There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn.

If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place
in joy. This word is not too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward
his rock, and the sorrow was in the beginning. When the images of earth
cling too tightly to memory, when the call of happiness becomes too
insistent, it happens that melancholy arises in man's heart: this is the rock's
victory, this is the rock itself. The boundless grief is too heavy to bear. These
are our nights of Gethsemane. But crushing truths perish from being
acknowledged. Thus, Edipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it. But
from the moment he knows, his tragedy begins. Yet at the same moment,
blind and desperate, he realizes that the only bond linking him to the world
is the cool hand of a girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out: "Despite so
many ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me
conclude that all is well." Sophocles' Edipus, like Dostoevsky's Kirilov, thus
gives the recipe for the absurd victory. Ancient wisdom confirms modern heroism.

One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of
happiness. "What!---by such narrow ways--?" There is but one world,
however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are
inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs
from the absurd. Discovery. It happens as well that the felling of the absurd
springs from happiness. "I conclude that all is well," says Edipus, and that
remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It
teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of this world a
god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile
suffering. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men.

All Sisyphus' silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His
rock is a thing. Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his
torment, silences all the idols. In the universe suddenly restored to its
silence, the myriad wondering little voices of the earth rise up. Unconscious,
secret calls, invitations from all the faces, they are the necessary reverse and
price of victory. There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know
the night. The absurd man says yes and his efforts will henceforth be
unceasing. If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least
there is, but one which he concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the
rest, he knows himself to be the master of his days. At that subtle moment
when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his
rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions
which become his fate, created by him, combined under his memory's eye
and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of
all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no
end, he is still on the go. The rock is still rolling.

I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden
again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and
raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth
without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that
stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a
world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.
One must imagine Sisyphus happy.



	Chocolate and Cocoa Recipes (1909)
	by:
	Miss Parloa


Cocoa and Chocolate

The term "Cocoa," a corruption of "Cacao," is almost universally used in
English-speaking countries to designate the seeds of the small tropical
tree known to botanists as THEOBROMA CACAO, from which a great variety
of preparations under the name of cocoa and chocolate for eating and
drinking are made. The name "Chocolatl" is nearly the same in most
European languages, and is taken from the Mexican name of the drink,
"Chocolate" or "Cacahuatl." The Spaniards found chocolate in common use
among the Mexicans at the time of the invasion under Cortez in 1519, and
it was introduced into Spain immediately after. The Mexicans not only
used chocolate as a staple article of food, but they used the seeds of
the cacao tree as a medium of exchange.

No better evidence could be offered of the great advance which has been
made in recent years in the knowledge of dietetics than the remarkable
increase in the consumption of cocoa and chocolate in this country. The
amount retained for home consumption in 1860 was only 1,181,054
pounds--about 3-5 of an ounce for each inhabitant. The amount retained
for home consumption for the year ending Dec. 31, 1908, was 93,956,721
pounds--over 16 ounces for each inhabitant.

Although there was a marked increase in the consumption of tea and
coffee during the same period, the ratio of increase fell far below that
of cocoa. It is evident that the coming American is going to be less of
a tea and coffee drinker, and more of a cocoa and chocolate drinker.
This is the natural result of a better knowledge of the laws of health,
and of the food value of a beverage which nourishes the body while it
also stimulates the brain.

Baron von Liebig, one of the best-known writers on dietetics, says:

"It is a perfect food, as wholesome as delicious, a beneficient restorer
of exhausted power; but its quality must be good and it must be
carefully prepared. It is highly nourishing and easily digested, and is
fitted to repair wasted strength, preserve health, and prolong life. It
agrees with dry temperaments and convalescents; with mothers who nurse
their children; with those whose occupations oblige them to undergo
severe mental strains; with public speakers, and with all those who give
to work a portion of the time needed for sleep. It soothes both stomach
and brain, and for this reason, as well as for others, it is the best
friend of those engaged in literary pursuits."

M. Brillat-Savarin, in his entertaining and valuable work, _Physiologie
du Goût_, says: "Chocolate came over the mountains [from Spain to
France] with Anne of Austria, daughter of Philip III and queen of Louis
XIII. The Spanish monks also spread the knowledge of it by the presents
they made to their brothers in France. It is well known that Linnæus
called the fruit of the cocoa tree _theobroma_, 'food for the gods.' The
cause of this emphatic qualification has been sought, and attributed by
some to the fact that he was extravagantly fond of chocolate; by others
to his desire to please his confessor; and by others to his gallantry, a
queen having first introduced it into France.

"The Spanish ladies of the New World, it is said, carried their love for
chocolate to such a degree that, not content with partaking of it
several times a day, they had it sometimes carried after them to church.
This favoring of the senses often drew upon them the censures of the
bishop; but the Reverend Father Escobar, whose metaphysics were as
subtle as his morality was accommodating, declared, formally, that a
fast was not broken by chocolate prepared with water; thus wire-drawing,
in favor of his penitents, the ancient adage, '_Liquidum non frangit
jejunium._'

"Time and experience," he says further, "have shown that chocolate,
carefully prepared, is an article of food as wholesome as it is
agreeable; that it is nourishing, easy of digestion, and does not
possess those qualities injurious to beauty with which coffee has been
reproached; that it is excellently adapted to persons who are obliged to
a great concentration of intellect; in the toils of the pulpit or the
bar, and especially to travellers; that it suits the most feeble
stomach; that excellent effects have been produced by it in chronic
complaints, and that it is a last resource in affections of the pylorus.

"Some persons complain of being unable to digest chocolate; others, on
the contrary, pretend that it has not sufficient nourishment, and that
the effect disappears too soon. It is probable that the former have only
themselves to blame, and that the chocolate which they use is of bad
quality or badly made; for good and well-made chocolate must suit every
stomach which retains the slightest digestive power.

"In regard to the others, the remedy is an easy one: they should
reinforce their breakfast with a _pâté_, a cutlet, or a kidney, moisten
the whole with a good draught of soconusco chocolate, and thank God for
a stomach of such superior activity.

"This gives me an opportunity to make an observation whose accuracy may
be depended upon.

"After a good, complete, and copious breakfast, if we take, in addition,
a cup of well-made chocolate, digestion will be perfectly accomplished
in three hours, and we may dine whenever we like. Out of zeal for
science, and by dint of eloquence, I have induced many ladies to try
this experiment. They all declared, in the beginning, that it would kill
them; but they have all thriven on it and have not failed to glorify
their teacher.

"The people who make constant use of chocolate are the ones who enjoy
the most steady health, and are the least subject to a multitude of
little ailments which destroy the comfort of life; their plumpness is
also more equal. These are two advantages which every one may verify
among his own friends, and wherever the practice is in use."

In corroboration of M. Brillat-Savarin's statement as to the value of
chocolate as an aid to digestion, we may quote from one of Mme. de
Sévigné's letters to her daughter:

"I took chocolate night before last to digest my dinner, in order to
have a good supper. I took some yesterday for nourishment, so as to be
able to fast until night. What I consider amusing about chocolate is
that it acts according to the wishes of the one who takes it."

Chocolate appears to have been highly valued as a remedial agent by the
leading physicians of that day. Christoph Ludwig Hoffman wrote a
treatise entitled, "Potus Chocolate," in which he recommended it in many
diseases, and instanced the case of Cardinal Richelieu, who, he stated,
was cured of general atrophy by its use.

A French officer who served in the West Indies for a period of fifteen
years, during the early part of the last century, wrote, as the result
of his personal observations, a treatise on "The Natural History of
Chocolate, Being a distinct and Particular Account of the Cacao Tree,
its Growth and Culture, and the Preparation, Excellent Properties, and
Medicinal Virtues of its Fruit," which received the approbation of the
Regent of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, and which was translated and
published in London, in 1730. After describing the different methods of
raising and curing the fruit and preparing it for food (which it is not
worth while to reproduce here, as the methods have essentially changed
since that time), he goes on to demonstrate, as the result of actual
experiment, that chocolate is a substance "very temperate, very
nourishing, and of easy digestion; very proper to repair the exhausted
spirits and decayed strength; and very suitable to preserve the health
and prolong the lives of old men....

"I could produce several instances," he says, "in favor of this
excellent nourishment; but I shall content myself with two only, equally
certain and decisive, in proof of its goodness. The first is an
experiment of chocolate's being taken for the only nourishment--made by
a surgeon's wife of Martinico. She had lost, by a very deplorable
accident, her lower jaw, which reduced her to such a condition that she
did not know how to subsist. She was not capable of taking anything
solid, and not rich enough to live upon jellies and nourishing broths.
In this strait she determined to take three dishes of chocolate,
prepared after the manner of the country, one in the morning, one at
noon, and one at night. There chocolate is nothing else but cocoa
kernels dissolved in hot water, with sugar, and seasoned with a bit of
cinnamon. This new way of life succeeded so well that she has lived a
long while since, more lively and robust than before this accident.

"I had the second relation from a gentleman of Martinico, and one of my
friends not capable of a falsity. He assured me that in his neighborhood
an infant of four months old unfortunately lost his nurse, and its
parents not being able to put it to another, resolved, through
necessity, to feed it with chocolate. The success was very happy, for
the infant came on to a miracle, and was neither less healthy nor less
vigorous than those who are brought up by the best nurses.

"Before chocolate was known in Europe, good old wine was called the milk
of old men; but this title is now applied with greater reason to
chocolate, since its use has become so common that it has been perceived
that chocolate is, with respect to them, what milk is to infants. In
reality, if one examines the nature of chocolate a little, with respect
to the constitution of aged persons, it seems as though the one was made
on purpose to remedy the defects of the other, and that it is truly the
panacea of old age."

The three associated beverages, cocoa, tea, and coffee are known to the
French as _aromatic_ drinks. Each of these has its characteristic aroma.
The fragrance and flavor are so marked that they cannot be imitated by
any artificial products, although numerous attempts have been made in
regard to all three. Hence the detection of adulteration is not a
difficult matter. Designing persons, aware of the extreme difficulty of
imitating these substances, have undertaken to employ lower grades, and,
by manipulation, copy, as far as may be, the higher sorts. Every one
knows how readily tea, and coffee, for that matter, will take up odors
and flavors from substances placed near them. This is abundantly
exemplified in the country grocery or general store, where the teas and
coffees share in the pervasive fragrance of the cheese and kerosene. But
perhaps it is not so widely understood that some of these very teas and
coffees had been artificially flavored or corrected before they reached
their destination in this country.

Cacao lends itself very readily to such preliminary treatment. In a
first-class article, the beans should be of the highest excellence; they
should be carefully grown on the plantation and there prepared with
great skill, arriving in the factory in good condition. In the factory
they should simply receive the mechanical treatment requisite to
develop their high and attractive natural flavor and fragrance. They
should be most carefully shelled after roasting and finely ground
without concealed additions. This is the process in all honest
manufactories of the cacao products.

Now, as a matter of fact, in the preparation of many of the cacao
products on the market, a wholly different course has been pursued.
Beans of poor quality are used, because of their cheapness, and in some
instances they are only imperfectly, if at all, shelled before grinding.
Chemical treatment is relied on to correct in part the odor and taste of
such inferior goods, and artificial flavors, other than the time-honored
natural vanilla and the like, are added freely. The detection of such
imposition is easy enough to the expert, but is difficult to the novice;
therefore the public is largely unable to discriminate between the good
and the inferior, and it is perforce compelled to depend almost entirely
on the character and reputation of the manufacturer.

A distinguished London Physician, in giving some hints concerning the
proper preparation of cocoa, says:

"Start with a pure cocoa of undoubted quality and excellence of
manufacture, and which bears the name of a respectable firm. This point
is important, for there are many cocoas on the market which have been
doctored by the addition of alkali, starch, malt, kola, hops, etc."

Baker's Breakfast Cocoa is absolutely pure, and, being ground to an
extraordinary degree of fineness, is highly soluble. The analyst of the
Massachusetts State Board of Health states in his recent valuable work
on "Food Inspection and Analysis," that the treatment of cocoa with
alkali for the purpose of producing a more perfect emulsion is
objectionable, even if not considered as a form of adulteration. Cocoa
thus treated is generally darker in color than the pure article. The
legitimate means, he says, for making it as soluble as possible is to
pulverize it very fine, so that particles remain in even suspension and
form a smooth paste.

That is the way the Baker Cocoa is treated. It has received the Grand
Prize--the highest award ever given in this country, and altogether 52
highest awards in Europe and America.




Choice Recipes by Miss Maria Parloa

SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR WALTER BAKER & Co. LTD.


PLAIN CHOCOLATE

For six people, use one quart of milk, two ounces of Walter Baker &
Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, one tablespoonful of cornstarch, three
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of hot water.

Mix the cornstarch with one gill of the milk. Put the remainder of the
milk on to heat in the double-boiler. When the milk comes to the boiling
point, stir in the cornstarch and cook for ten minutes. Have the
chocolate cut in fine bits, and put it in a small iron or granite-ware
pan; add the sugar and water, and place the pan over a hot fire. Stir
constantly until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add this to the hot
milk, and beat the mixture with a whisk until it is frothy. Or, the
chocolate may be poured back and forth from the boiler to a pitcher,
holding high the vessel from which you pour. This will give a thick
froth. Serve at once.

If you prefer not to have the chocolate thick, omit the cornstarch. If
condensed milk is used, substitute water for the milk named above and
add three tablespoonfuls of condensed milk when the chocolate is added.


CHOCOLATE, VIENNA STYLE

Use four ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Vanilla Chocolate, one quart of
milk, three tablespoonfuls of hot water, and one tablespoonful of sugar.

Cut the chocolate in fine bits. Put the milk on the stove in the
double-boiler, and when it has been heated to the boiling point, put the
chocolate, sugar and water in a small iron or granite-ware pan, and stir
over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Stir this mixture into the hot
milk, and beat well with a whisk. Serve at once, putting a tablespoonful
of whipped cream in each cup and then filling up with the chocolate.

The plain chocolate may be used instead of the vanilla, but in that case
use a teaspoonful of vanilla extract and three generous tablespoonfuls
of sugar instead of one.


BREAKFAST COCOA

Walter Baker & Co.'s Breakfast Cocoa is powdered so fine that it can be
dissolved by pouring boiling water on it. For this reason it is often
prepared at the table. A small teaspoonful of the powder is put in the
cup with a teaspoonful of sugar; on this is poured two-thirds of a cup
of boiling water, and milk or cream is added to suit the individual
taste. This is very convenient; but cocoa is not nearly so good when
prepared in this manner as when it is boiled.

For six cupfuls of cocoa use two tablespoonfuls of the powder, two
tablespoonfuls of sugar, half a pint of boiling water, and a pint and a
half of milk. Put the milk on the stove in the double-boiler. Put the
cocoa and sugar in a saucepan, and gradually pour the hot water upon
them, stirring all the time. Place the saucepan on the fire and stir
until the contents boil. Let this mixture boil for five minutes; then
add the boiling milk and serve.

A gill of cream is a great addition to this cocoa.

Scalded milk may be used in place of boiled milk, if preferred. For
flavoring, a few grains of salt and half a teaspoonful of vanilla
extract may be added.


CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE

Beat half a cupful of butter to a cream, and gradually beat into it one
cupful of sugar. When this is light, beat in half a cupful of milk, a
little at a time, and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat the whites of six
eggs to a stiff froth. Mix half a teaspoonful of baking powder with two
scant cupfuls of sifted flour. Stir the flour and whites of eggs
alternately into the mixture. Have three deep tin plates well buttered,
and spread two-thirds of the batter in two of them.

Into the remaining batter stir one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium
No. 1 Chocolate, melted, and spread this batter in the third plate. Bake
the cakes in a moderate oven for about twenty minutes. Put a layer of
white cake on a large plate, and spread with white icing. Put the dark
cake on this, and also spread with white icing. On this put the third
cake. Spread with chocolate icing.

TO MAKE THE ICING. Put into a granite-ware saucepan two gills of sugar
and one of water, and boil gently until bubbles begin to come from the
bottom--say, about five minutes. Take from the fire instantly. Do not
stir or shake the sugar while it is cooking. Pour the hot syrup in a
thin stream into the whites of two eggs that have been beaten to a stiff
froth, beating the mixture all the time. Continue to beat until the
icing is thick. Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla. Use two-thirds
of this as a white icing, and to the remaining third add one ounce of
melted chocolate. To melt the chocolate, shave it fine and put in a cup,
which is then to be placed in a pan of boiling water.


CHOCOLATE CAKE

For two sheets of cake, use three ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium
No. 1 Chocolate, three eggs, one cupful and three-fourths of sifted
pastry flour, one cupful and three-fourths of sugar, half a cupful of
butter, half a cupful of milk, half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract,
one teaspoonful and a half of baking powder.

Grate the chocolate. Beat the butter to a cream, and gradually beat in
the sugar. Beat in the milk and vanilla, then the eggs (already well
beaten), next the chocolate, and finally the flour, in which the baking
powder should be mixed. Pour into two well buttered shallow cake pans.
Bake for twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven. Frost or not, as you
like.


CHOCOLATE MARBLE CAKE

Put one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate and one tablespoonful of
butter in a cup, and set this in a pan of boiling water. Beat to a cream
half a cupful of butter and one cupful of sugar. Gradually beat in half
a cupful of milk. Now add the whites of six eggs beaten to a stiff
froth, one teaspoonful of vanilla, and a cupful and a half of sifted
flour, in which is mixed one teaspoonful of baking powder. Put about
one-third of this mixture into another bowl, and stir the melted butter
and chocolate into it. Drop the white-and-brown mixture in spoonfuls
into a well buttered deep cake pan, and bake in a moderate oven for
about forty-five minutes; or, the cake can be baked in a sheet and iced
with a chocolate or white icing.


CHOCOLATE GLACÉ CAKE

Beat to a cream a generous half cupful of butter, and gradually beat
into this one cupful of sugar. Add one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s
Premium No. 1 Chocolate, melted; also two unbeaten eggs. Beat vigorously
for five minutes; then stir in half a cupful of milk, and lastly, one
cupful and a half of flour, with which has been mixed one generous
teaspoonful of baking powder. Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla.
Pour into a buttered, shallow cake pan, and bake for half an hour in a
moderate oven. When cool, spread with glacé frosting.

GLACÉ FROSTING. Put half a cupful of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of
water in a small saucepan. Stir over the fire until the sugar is nearly
melted. Take the spoon from the pan before the sugar really begins to
boil, because it would spoil the icing if the syrup were stirred after
it begins to boil. After boiling gently for four minutes, add half a
teaspoonful of vanilla extract, but do not stir; then set away to cool.
When the syrup is about blood warm, beat it with a wooden spoon until
thick and white. Now put the saucepan in another with boiling water, and
stir until the icing is thin enough to pour. Spread quickly on the cake.


CHOCOLATE GLACÉ

After making a glacé frosting, dissolve one ounce of Walter Baker &
Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate in a cup, and put it with the frosting,
adding also a tablespoonful of boiling water.


CHOCOLATE BISCUIT

Cover three large baking pans with paper that has been well oiled with
washed butter. Over these dredge powdered sugar. Melt in a cup one ounce
of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate. Separate the whites and
yolks of four eggs. Add to the yolks a generous half cupful of powdered
sugar, and beat until light and firm. Add the melted chocolate, and beat
a few minutes longer. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth.
Measure out three-fourths of a cupful of sifted flour, and stir it and
the whites into the yolks. The whites and flour must be cut in as
lightly as possible, and with very little stirring. Drop the mixture in
teaspoonfuls on the buttered paper. Sprinkle powdered sugar over the
cakes, and bake in a slow oven for about fourteen or fifteen minutes.
The mixture can be shaped like lady fingers, if preferred.


CHOCOLATE WAFERS

Grate four ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and
mix with it two tablespoonfuls of flour and one-fourth of a teaspoonful
each of cinnamon, cloves and baking powder. Separate six eggs. Add one
cupful of powdered sugar to the yolks, and beat until very light; then
add the grated yellow rind and the juice of half a lemon, and beat five
minutes longer. Now add the dry mixture, and with a spoon lightly cut in
the whites, which are first to be beaten to a stiff froth. Pour the
mixture into buttered shallow pans, having it about half an inch thick.
Bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. When the cake is cool, spread
a thin layer of currant jelly over one sheet, and place the other sheet
on this. Ice with vanilla icing; and when this hardens, cut in squares.
It is particularly nice to serve with ice-cream.


CINDERELLA CAKES

Use two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one cupful and a quarter of flour,
one gill of cold water, one tablespoonful of lemon juice, one
teaspoonful of baking powder, one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium
No. 1 Chocolate, half a tumbler of any kind of jelly, and chocolate
icing the same as for éclairs.

Separate the eggs, and beat the yolks and sugar together until light.
Beat the whites until light, and then beat them with yolks and sugar and
grated chocolate. Next beat in the lemon juice and water, and finally
the flour, in which the baking powder should be mixed. Beat for three
minutes, and then pour the batter into two pans, and bake in a moderate
oven for about eighteen minutes. When done, spread one sheet of cake
with the jelly, and press the other sheet over it; and when cold, cut
into little squares and triangular pieces. Stick a wooden toothpick into
each of these pieces and dip each one into the hot icing, afterwards
removing the toothpick, of course.


CHOCOLATE ÉCLAIRS

Into a granite-ware saucepan put half a pint of milk, two well-rounded
tablespoonfuls of butter, and one tablespoonful of sugar, and place on
the stove. When this boils up, add half a pint of sifted flour, and cook
for two minutes, beating well with a wooden spoon. It will be smooth and
velvety at the end of that time. Set away to cool; and when cool, beat
in four eggs, one at a time. Beat vigorously for about fifteen minutes.
Try a small bit of the paste in the oven; and if it rises in the form of
a hollow ball, the paste is beaten enough; whereas, if it does not, beat
a little longer. Have tin sheets or shallow pans slightly buttered. Have
ready, also, a tapering tin tube, with the smaller opening about
three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Place this in the small end of a
conical cotton pastry bag. Put the mixture in the bag, and press out on
buttered pans, having each éclair nearly three inches long. There should
be eighteen, and they must be at least two inches apart, as they swell
in cooking. Bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty-five minutes.
Take from the oven, and while they are still warm coat them with
chocolate. When cold, cut open on the side, and fill with either of the
following described preparations:--

FILLING NO. 1.--Mix in a bowl half a pint of rich cream, one teaspoonful
of vanilla, and four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Place the bowl in a pan of
ice-water, and beat the cream until light and firm, using either an
egg-beater or a whisk.

FILLING NO. 2.--Put half a pint of milk into a double-boiler, and place
on the fire. Beat together until very light one level tablespoonful of
flour, half a cupful of sugar, and one egg. When the milk boils, stir in
this mixture. Add one-eighth of a teaspoonful of salt, and cook for
fifteen minutes, stirring often. When cold, flavor with one teaspoonful
of vanilla.

ICING FOR ÉCLAIRS.--Put in a small granite-ware pan half a pint of sugar
and five tablespoonfuls of cold water. Stir until the sugar is
partially melted, and then place on the stove, stirring for half a
minute. Take out the spoon, and watch the sugar closely. As soon as it
boils, take instantly from the fire and pour upon a meat-platter. Let
this stand for eight minutes. Meantime, shave into a cup one ounce of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it on the fire in
a pan of boiling water. At the end of eight minutes stir the sugar with
a wooden spoon until it begins to grow white and to thicken. Add the
melted chocolate quickly, and continue stirring until the mixture is
thick. Put it in a small saucepan, and place on the fire in another pan
of hot water. Stir until so soft that it will pour freely. Stick a
skewer into the side of an éclair, and dip the top in the hot chocolate.
Place on a plate, and continue until all the éclairs are "glacéd." They
will dry quickly. Do not stir the sugar after the first half minute, and
do not scrape the sugar from the saucepan into the platter. All the
directions must be strictly followed.


CHOCOLATE COOKIES

Beat to a cream half a cupful of butter and one tablespoonful of lard.
Gradually beat into this one cupful of sugar; then add one-fourth of a
teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, and two ounces of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, melted. Now add one
well-beaten egg, and half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in two
tablespoonfuls of milk. Stir in about two cupfuls and a half of flour.
Roll thin, and, cutting in round cakes, bake in a rather quick oven. The
secret of making good cookies is the use of as little flour as will
suffice.


CHOCOLATE GINGERBREAD

Mix in a large bowl one cupful of molasses, half a cupful of sour milk
or cream, one teaspoonful of ginger, one of cinnamon, half a teaspoonful
of salt. Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a teaspoonful of cold
water; add this and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter to the mixture.
Now stir in two cupfuls of sifted flour, and finally add two ounces of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate and one tablespoonful of butter, melted
together. Pour the mixture into three well-buttered, deep tin plates,
and bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty minutes.


VANILLA ICING

Break the white of one large egg into a bowl, and gradually beat into it
one cupful of confectioners' sugar. Beat for three minutes, add half a
teaspoonful of vanilla extract, and spread thinly on the cakes.


CHOCOLATE ICING

Make a vanilla icing, and add one tablespoonful of cold water to it.
Scrape fine one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate,
and put it in a small iron or granite-ware saucepan, with two
tablespoonfuls of confectioners' sugar and one tablespoonful of hot
water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, then add another
tablespoonful of hot water. Stir the dissolved chocolate into the
vanilla icing.


CHOCOLATE PROFITEROLES

Shave into a cup one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1
Chocolate, and put the cup into a pan of boiling water. Make a paste the
same as for éclairs, save that instead of one tablespoonful of sugar
three must be used.

As soon as the paste is cooked, beat in the melted chocolate. When cold,
add the eggs, and beat until light. Drop this batter on lightly buttered
pans in round cakes, having about a dessertspoonful in each cake. Bake
for about twenty minutes in a moderately hot oven. Serve either hot or
cold, with whipped cream prepared the same as for Filling No. 1 for
éclairs. Heap the cream in the center of a flat dish, and arrange the
profiteroles around it.


CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM

For about two quarts and a half of cream use a pint and a half of milk,
a quart of thin cream, two cupfuls of sugar, two ounces of Walter Baker
& Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, two eggs, and two heaping
tablespoonfuls of flour.

Put the milk on to boil in a double-boiler. Put the flour and one cupful
of the sugar in a bowl; add the eggs, and beat the mixture until light.
Stir this into the boiling milk, and cook for twenty minutes, stirring
often.

Scrape the chocolate, and put it in a small saucepan. Add four
tablespoonfuls of sugar (which should be taken from the second cupful)
and two tablespoonfuls of hot water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth
and glossy. Add this to the cooking mixture.

When the preparation has cooked for twenty minutes, take it from the
fire and add the remainder of the sugar and the cream, which should be
gradually beaten into the hot mixture. Set away to cool, and when cold,
freeze.


CHOCOLATE CREAM PIES

Beat to a cream half a cupful of butter and a cupful and a quarter of
powdered sugar. Add two well-beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of wine,
half a cupful of milk, and a cupful and a half of sifted flour, with
which has been mixed a teaspoonful and a half of baking powder. Bake
this in four well-buttered, deep, tin plates for about fifteen minutes
in a moderate oven.

Put half a pint of milk in the double-boiler, and on the fire. Beat
together the yolks of two eggs, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar,
and a level tablespoonful of flour. Stir this mixture into the boiling
milk, beating well. Add one-sixth of a teaspoonful of salt, and cook for
fifteen minutes, stirring often. When cooked, flavor with half a
teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Put two of the cakes on two large
plates, spread the cream over them, and lay the other two cakes on top.
Beat the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth, and then beat into
them one cupful of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Shave
one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it in
a small pan with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one tablespoonful of
boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Now add
three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, and stir into the beaten egg and
sugar. Spread on the pies and set away for a few hours.


CHOCOLATE MOUSSE

Put a three-quart mould in a wooden pail, first lining the bottom with
fine ice and a thin layer of coarse salt. Pack the space between the
mould and the pail solidly with fine ice and coarse salt, using two
quarts of salt and ice enough to fill the space. Whip one quart of
cream, and drain it in a sieve. Whip again all the cream that drains
through. Put in a small pan one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium
No. 1 Chocolate, three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water,
and stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Add three
tablespoonfuls of cream. Sprinkle a cupful of powdered sugar over the
whipped cream. Pour the chocolate in a thin stream into the cream, and
stir gently until well mixed. Wipe out the chilled mould, and turn the
cream into it. Cover, and then place a little ice lightly on top. Wet a
piece of carpet in water, and cover the top of the pail. Set away for
three or four hours; then take the mould from the ice, dip it in cold
water, wipe, and then turn the mousse out on a flat dish.


CHOCOLATE CHARLOTTE

Soak a quarter of a package of gelatine in one-third of a cupful of cold
water for two hours. Whip one pint of cream to a froth, and put it in a
bowl, which should be placed in a pan of ice-water. Put half an ounce of
shaved chocolate in a small pan with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one
of boiling water, and stir over the hot fire until smooth and glossy.
Add to this a gill of hot milk and the soaked gelatine, and stir until
the gelatine is dissolved. Sprinkle a generous half cupful of powdered
sugar over the cream. Now add the chocolate and gelatine mixture, and
stir gently until it begins to thicken. Line a quart charlotte-mould
with lady fingers, and when the cream is so thick that it will just
pour, turn it gently into the mould. Place the charlotte in a cold
place for an hour or more, and, at serving time, turn out on a flat
dish.


CHOCOLATE BAVARIAN CREAM

For one large mould of cream, use half a package of gelatine, one gill
of milk, two quarts of whipped cream, one gill of sugar, and two and a
half ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate.

Soak the gelatine in cold water for two hours. Whip and drain the cream,
scrape the chocolate, and put the milk on to boil. Put the chocolate,
two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of hot water in a small saucepan,
and stir on a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Stir this into the hot
milk. Now add the soaked gelatine and the remainder of the sugar. Strain
this mixture into a basin that will hold two quarts or more. Place the
basin in a pan of ice-water, and stir until cold, when it will begin to
thicken. Instantly begin to stir in the whipped cream, adding half the
amount at first. When all the cream has been added, dip the mould in
cold water and turn the cream into it. Place in the ice-chest for an
hour or more.

At serving-time dip the mould in tepid water. See that the cream will
come from the sides of the mould, and turn out on a flat dish. Serve
with whipped cream.


CHOCOLATE CREAM

Soak a box of gelatine in half a pint of cold water for two hours. Put
one quart of milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire. Shave two
ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it in a
small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water.
Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir into the hot
milk. Beat the yolks of five eggs with half a cupful of sugar. Add to
the gelatine, and stir the mixture into the hot milk. Cook three minutes
longer, stirring all the while. On taking from the fire, add two
teaspoonfuls of vanilla and half a saltspoonful of salt. Strain, and
pour into moulds that have been rinsed in cold water. Set away to
harden, and serve with sugar and cream.


CHOCOLATE BLANC-MANGE

Put one quart of milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire.
Sprinkle into it one level tablespoonful of sea-moss farina. Cover, and
cook until the mixture looks white, stirring frequently. It will take
about twenty minutes. While the milk and farina are cooking, shave two
ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it into
a small pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water.
Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, then stir into the cooked
mixture. Add a saltspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of vanilla.
Strain, and turn into a mould that has been rinsed in cold water. Set
the mould in a cold place, and do not disturb it until the blanc-mange
is cold and firm. Serve with sugar and cream.


CHOCOLATE CREAM RENVERSEE

Use one quart of milk, seven eggs, half a pint of sugar, one ounce of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, half a teaspoonful of
salt. Put the milk on the fire in the double-boiler. Shave the
chocolate, and put it in a small pan with three tablespoonfuls of the
sugar and one of boiling water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and
glossy; then stir into the hot milk, and take the milk from the fire to
cool.

Put three tablespoonfuls of sugar into a charlotte-mould that will hold
a little more than a quart, and place on the stove. When the sugar melts
and begins to smoke, move the mould round and round, to coat it with the
burnt sugar, then place on the table. Beat together the remainder of the
sugar, the eggs, and the salt. Add the cold milk and chocolate to the
mixture, and after straining into the charlotte-mould, place in a deep
pan, with enough tepid water to come nearly to the top of the mould.
Bake in a moderate oven until firm in the center. Test the cream by
running a knife through the center. If firm and smooth, it is done. It
will take forty or forty-five minutes to cook. When icy-cold, turn on a
flat dish. Serve with whipped cream that has been flavored with sugar
and vanilla.


BAKED CHOCOLATE CUSTARD

For five small custards use one pint of milk, two eggs, one ounce of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, one-fourth of a
teaspoonful of salt, and a piece of stick cinnamon about an inch long.

Put the cinnamon and milk in the double-boiler, place on the fire and
cook for ten minutes. Shave the chocolate, and put it in a small pan
with three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water. Stir this
over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir it into the hot
milk, after which take the liquid mixture from the fire and cool.

Beat together with a spoon the eggs, salt and two tablespoonfuls of the
sugar. Add the cooled milk and strain. Pour the mixture into the cups,
which place in a deep pan. Pour into the pan enough tepid water to come
nearly to the top of the cups. Bake in a moderate oven until firm in the
center. It will take about half an hour. Test by running a knife through
the center. If the custard is milky, it is not done. Serve very cold.


CHOCOLATE SOUFFLÉ

Half a pint of milk, two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate, three
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one rounding tablespoonful of butter, two
tablespoonfuls of flour, four eggs.

Put the milk in the double-boiler, and place on the fire. Beat the
butter to a soft cream, and beat the flour into it. Gradually pour the
hot milk on this, stirring all the time. Return to the fire and cook for
six minutes. Put the shaved chocolate, sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of
water in a small pan over a hot fire, and stir until smooth and glossy.
Stir this into the mixture in the double-boiler. Take from the fire and
add the yolks of the eggs, well beaten; then set away to cool. When cool
add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour the batter
into a well-buttered earthen dish that will hold about a quart, and cook
in a moderate oven for twenty-two minutes. Serve immediately with
vanilla cream sauce.


CHOCOLATE PUDDING

Reserve one gill of milk from a quart, and put the remainder on the fire
in a double-boiler. Mix three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with the cold
milk. Beat two eggs with half a cupful of powdered sugar and half a
teaspoonful of salt. Add this to the cornstarch and milk, and stir into
the boiling milk, beating well for a minute. Shave fine two ounces of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, and put it into a small
pan with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water. Stir
over a hot fire until smooth and glossy; then beat into the hot pudding.
Cook the pudding in all ten minutes, counting from the time the eggs and
cornstarch are added. Serve cold with powdered sugar and cream. This
pudding can be poured while hot into little cups which have been rinsed
in cold water. At serving time turn out on a flat dish, making a circle,
and fill the center of the dish with whipped cream flavored with sugar
and vanilla.

The eggs may be omitted, in which case use one more tablespoonful of
cornstarch.


CHOCOLATE MERINGUE PUDDING

For a small pudding use one pint of milk, two tablespoonfuls and a half
of cornstarch, one ounce of Walter Baker & Co.'s Chocolate, two eggs,
five tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of
salt, and half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract.

Mix the cornstarch with one gill of the milk. Put the remainder of the
milk on to boil in the double-boiler. Scrape the chocolate. When the
milk boils, add the cornstarch, salt, and chocolate, and cook for ten
minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs with three tablespoonfuls of sugar.
Pour the hot mixture on this, and beat well. Turn into a pudding-dish
that will hold about a quart, and bake for twenty minutes in a moderate
oven.

Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth, and gradually beat in
the remaining two tablespoonfuls of sugar and the vanilla. Spread this
on the pudding, and return to the oven. Cook for fifteen minutes longer,
but with the oven-door open. Serve either cold or hot.


MILTON PUDDING

Use one pint of stale bread broken in crumbs, one quart of milk, two
eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon,
three tablespoonfuls of sugar and two ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s
Chocolate, grated. Put the bread, milk, cinnamon, and chocolate in a
bowl, and soak for two or three hours. Beat together the eggs, sugar,
and salt. Mash the soaked bread with a spoon, and add the egg mixture to
the bread and milk. Pour into a pudding-dish, and bake in a slow oven
for about forty minutes. Serve with an egg sauce or a vanilla cream
sauce.

EGG SAUCE.--Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff, dry froth; and beat
into this, a little at a time, one cupful of powdered sugar. When smooth
and light, add one teaspoonful of vanilla and the yolks of two eggs.
Beat the mixture a little longer; then stir in one cupful of whipped
cream or three tablespoonfuls of milk. Serve at once.

VANILLA CREAM SAUCE.--Beat to a cream three tablespoonfuls of butter,
and gradually beat into this two-thirds of a cupful of powdered sugar.
When this is light and creamy, add a teaspoonful of vanilla; then
gradually beat in two cupfuls of whipped cream. Place the bowl in a pan
of boiling water, and stir constantly for three minutes. Pour the sauce
into a warm bowl, and serve.


SNOW PUDDING

Put a pint of milk in the double-boiler and on the fire. Mix three
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with a gill of milk and one-third of a
teaspoonful of salt. Stir this into the milk when it boils. Beat the
whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, and then gradually beat into them
half a cupful of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Add this
to the cooking mixture, and beat vigorously for one minute. Rinse a
mould in cold water, and pouring the pudding into it, set away to cool.
At serving-time turn out on a flat dish, and serve with chocolate sauce.


CHOCOLATE SAUCE

Put one pint of milk in the double-boiler, and on the fire. Shave two
ounces of Walter Baker and Co.'s Chocolate, and put it in a small pan
with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two of boiling water. Stir over
the fire until smooth and glossy, and add to the hot milk. Beat together
for eight minutes the yolks of four eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar,
and a saltspoonful of salt, and then add one gill of cold milk.

Pour the boiling milk on this, stirring well. Return to the
double-boiler, and cook for five minutes, stirring all the time. Pour
into a cold bowl and set the bowl in cold water. Stir for a few minutes,
and then occasionally until the sauce is cold.

This sauce is nice for cold or hot cornstarch pudding, bread pudding,
cold cabinet pudding, snow pudding, etc. It will also answer for a
dessert. Fill custard glasses with it, and serve the same as soft
custard; or have the glasses two-thirds full, and heap up with whipped
cream.


CHOCOLATE CANDY

One cupful of molasses, two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of milk,
one-half pound of chocolate, a piece of butter half the size of an egg.
Boil the milk and molasses together, scrape the chocolate fine, and mix
with just enough of the boiling milk and molasses to moisten; rub it
perfectly smooth, then, with the sugar, stir into the boiling liquid;
add the butter, and boil twenty minutes. Try as molasses candy, and if
it hardens, pour into a buttered dish. Cut the same as nut candy.


CREAM CHOCOLATE CARAMELS

Mix together in a granite-ware saucepan half a pint of sugar, half a
pint of molasses, half a pint of thick cream, one generous tablespoonful
of butter, and four ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1
Chocolate. Place on the fire and stir until the mixture boils. Cook
until a few drops of it will harden if dropped into ice-water; then pour
into well-buttered pans, having the mixture about three-fourths of an
inch deep. When nearly cold, mark into squares. It will take almost an
hour to boil this in a granite-ware pan, but not half so long if cooked
in an iron frying-pan. Stir frequently while boiling. The caramels must
be put in a very cold place to harden.


SUGAR CHOCOLATE CARAMELS

Mix two cupfuls of sugar, three-fourths of a cupful of milk or cream,
one generous tablespoonful of butter, and three ounces of Walter Baker &
Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate. Place on the fire and cook, stirring
often, until a little of the mixture, when dropped in ice-water, will
harden; then stir in one-fourth of a cupful of sugar and one
tablespoonful of vanilla, and pour into a well-buttered pan, having the
mixture about three-fourths of an inch deep. When nearly cold, mark it
off in squares, and put in a cold place to harden. These caramels are
sugary and brittle, and can be made in the hottest weather without
trouble. If a deep granite-ware saucepan be used for the boiling, it
will take nearly an hour to cook the mixture; but if with an iron
frying-pan, twenty or thirty minutes will suffice.


CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 1

Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth. Gradually beat into this
two cupfuls of confectioners' sugar. If the eggs be large, it may take a
little more sugar. Flavor with half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and work
well. Now roll into little balls, and drop on a slightly buttered
platter. Let the balls stand for an hour or more. Shave five ounces of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate and put into a small bowl,
which place on the fire in a saucepan containing boiling water. When the
chocolate is melted, take the saucepan to the table, and drop the creams
into the chocolate one at a time, taking them out with a fork and
dropping them gently on the buttered dish. It will take half an hour or
more to harden the chocolate.


CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 2

For these creams you should make a fondant in this way: put into a
granite-ware saucepan one cupful of water and two of granulated
sugar--or a pound of loaf sugar. Stir until the sugar is nearly melted,
then place on the fire and heat slowly, but do not stir the mixture.
Watch carefully and note when it begins to boil. When the sugar has been
boiling for ten minutes, take up a little of it and drop in ice-water.
If it hardens enough to form a soft ball when rolled between the thumb
and finger, it is cooked enough. Take the saucepan from the fire
instantly, and set in a cool, dry place. When the syrup is so cool that
the finger can be held in it comfortably, pour it into a bowl, and stir
with a wooden spoon until it becomes thick and white. When it begins to
look dry, and a little hard, take out the spoon, and work with the hand
until the cream is soft and smooth. Flavor with a few drops of vanilla,
and, after shaping, cover with chocolate, as directed in the preceding
recipe.

_Caution._--Do not stir the syrup while it is cooking, and be careful
not to jar or shake the saucepan.


CHOCOLATE CONES

Boil the sugar as directed for fondant in the recipe for Chocolate
Creams, No. 2, but not quite so long--say about eleven minutes. The
syrup, when tested, should be too soft to ball. When cold, pour into a
bowl, and beat until thick and creamy. If properly boiled, it will not
become thick enough to work with the hands.

Have six ounces of Walter Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate melted
in a bowl. Pour half of the creamed sugar into another bowl, and, after
flavoring with a few drops of vanilla, add to it about one-third of the
dissolved chocolate. Stir until thick and rather dry; then make into
small cones, and drop on a slightly buttered platter. Put half of the
remaining creamed sugar in a cup, and set in a saucepan containing
boiling water. Flavor with vanilla, and stir over the fire until melted
so much that it will pour from the spoon. Take the saucepan to the table
and dip one-half the cones in, one at a time, just as the Chocolate
Creams, No. 1, were dipped in the melted chocolate. If liked, a second
coating may be given the cones. Now put the remainder of the creamed
sugar on to melt, and add two tablespoonfuls of hot water to it. Stir
the remainder of the melted chocolate into this, and if too thick to dip
the candy in, add hot water, a few drops at a time, until the mixture is
of the right consistency; then dip the rest of the cones in this.


GENESEE BON-BONS

Make the cream chocolate caramels, and get them quite firm by placing
the pan on ice. Make the chocolate coating as directed for chocolate
cones. Dip the caramels in this and put on a buttered dish.


CHOCOLATE SYRUP

Into a granite-ware saucepan put one ounce--three tablespoonfuls--of
Walter Baker & Co.'s Soluble Chocolate, and gradually pour on it half a
pint of boiling water, stirring all the time. Place on the fire, and
stir until all the chocolate is dissolved. Now add one pint of
granulated sugar, and stir until it begins to boil. Cook for three
minutes longer, then strain and cool. When cool, add one tablespoonful
of vanilla extract. Bottle, and keep in a cold place.


REFRESHING DRINKS FOR SUMMER

Put into a tumbler about two tablespoonfuls of broken ice, two
tablespoonfuls of chocolate syrup, three tablespoonfuls of whipped
cream, one gill of milk, and half a gill of soda-water from a syphon
bottle, or Apollinaris water. Stir well before drinking. A tablespoonful
of vanilla ice-cream is a desirable addition. It is a delicious drink,
even if the soda or Apollinaris water and ice-cream be omitted. A
plainer drink is made by combining the syrup, a gill and a half of milk,
and the ice, shaking well.


A FEW SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO CHOCOLATE

The best flavor to add to chocolate is vanilla; next to that, cinnamon.
Beyond these two things one should use great caution, as it is very easy
to spoil the fine natural flavor of the bean. Chocolate absorbs odors
readily; therefore it should be kept in a pure, sweet atmosphere. As
about eleven per cent. of the chocolate bean is starch, chocolate and
cocoa are of a much finer flavor if boiled for a few minutes. Long
boiling, however, ruins their flavor and texture.




Recipes Specially Prepared _by_ Miss Elizabeth Kevill Burr

(All measurements should be level.)


FORMULA FOR MAKING THREE GALLONS OF BREAKFAST COCOA

    1/2 a pound of Walter Baker & Co.'s Cocoa,
    1-1/2 gallons of water, hot,
    1-1/2 gallons of milk, hot.

This should not be allowed to boil. Either make it in a large
double-boiler, or a large saucepan or kettle over water. Mix the cocoa
with enough cold water to make a paste, and be sure it is free from
lumps. Heat together the milk and water, and pour in the cocoa; then
cook at least an hour, stirring occasionally.


CRACKED COCOA

To one-third a cup of Baker's Cracked Cocoa (sometimes called "Cocoa
Nibs") use three cups of cold water; cook slowly at least one hour--the
longer the better. Then strain the liquid and add one cup (or more if
desired) of milk, and serve very hot. Do not allow the mixture to boil
after milk has been added.


VANILLA CHOCOLATE WITH WHIPPED CREAM

    One cake (1/2 a pound) of Walter Baker & Co.'s Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,
    4 cups of boiling water,
    Pinch of salt,
    4 cups of hot milk.

This must be made in a double-boiler. Put the chocolate, boiling water
and salt in upper part of the double-boiler. Stir and beat with a wooden
spoon until the chocolate is dissolved and smooth. Add the milk and when
thoroughly hot, strain, and serve with unsweetened whipped cream. More
cooking will improve it.


CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE

Line a pie plate with rich pie crust, putting on an extra edge of crust
the same as for custard pie. Fill with the chocolate filling made after
the following recipe. Bake in a hot oven until crust is done; remove,
and when cool, cover with a meringue and brown very slowly in moderate
oven.


CHOCOLATE FILLING

    1 cup of milk,
    Pinch of salt,
    1-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of flour,
    2 eggs (yolks),
    5 tablespoonfuls of sugar (level),
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Put milk, salt and chocolate in upper part of the double-boiler, and
when hot and smooth, stir in the flour, which has been mixed with enough
cold milk to be thin enough to pour into the hot milk. Cook, stirring
constantly, until it thickens; then let it cook eight or ten minutes.
Mix the eggs and sugar together and pour the hot mixture over them,
stirring well; put back in double-boiler and cook, stirring constantly
one minute. Remove, and when cool add one teaspoonful of vanilla.


MERINGUE

    2 eggs (whites),
    Pinch of salt,
    4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Add salt to eggs and beat in a large shallow dish with fork or egg-whip
until stiff and flaky and dish can be turned upside down. Beat in the
sugar slowly, then the vanilla, and beat until the dish can be turned
upside down.


COCOA STICKS

    6 tablespoonfuls of butter,
    3/4 cup of sugar (scant),
    1 egg,
    1 tablespoonful of milk,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla or pinch of cinnamon,
    5 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    1/8 teaspoonful of baking powder,
    1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups of sifted pastry flour.

Cream the butter until soft; add the sugar gradually and beat well; add
the beaten egg, milk and vanilla; mix thoroughly. Sift cocoa, baking
powder, and a pinch of salt with about one-half cup of the flour; stir
this into the mixture first, then use the remainder of the flour, and
more if necessary, to make a firm dough that will not stick to the
fingers. Set on the ice to harden. Sprinkle the board with cocoa and a
very little sugar. Use small pieces of the dough at a time, toss it over
the board to prevent sticking, roll out thin, cut in strips about
one-half inch wide and three inches long. Place closely in pan and bake
in moderately hot oven three or four minutes. Great care should be taken
in the baking to prevent burning.

It is advisable to gather the scraps after each rolling, if soft, and
set away to harden, for fear of getting in too much cocoa, thus making
them bitter.

The colder and harder the dough is, the better it can be handled;
therefore it can be made the day before using.


COCOA FROSTING

    4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,
    3 tablespoonfuls of hot water,
    1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla,
    About 1-3/4 cups of confectioners' sugar.

Put the cocoa in a small saucepan; add the cold water and stir until
perfectly smooth; then the hot water, and cook for one or two minutes,
add vanilla and a speck of salt, then stir in enough sugar to make it
stiff enough to spread nicely. Beat until smooth and glossy and free
from lumps.

If too thick, add a little cold water. If not thick enough, add a little
sugar. Never make a frosting so stiff that it will have to be made
smooth with a wet knife. It is better to let it run to the sides of the
cake. For frosting sides of the cake, make a little stiffer.

This frosting never cracks as an egg frosting, but is hard enough to cut
nicely.


COCOA SAUCE

    2 tablespoonfuls of butter,
    1 cup of boiling water,
    2 tablespoonfuls of flour,
    4 tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Melt the butter in the saucepan; mix the flour and cocoa together and
stir into the butter; add gradually the hot water, stirring and beating
each time; cook until it thickens. Just before serving, add the sugar,
vanilla and a pinch of salt, if necessary.

Use more cocoa if liked stronger. This sauce will be found excellent for
cottage puddings, Dutch apple cakes, steamed apple puddings, etc.


COCOA CAKE

    1/2 a cup of butter,
    3/4 a cup of milk,
    1 cup of sugar,
    6 level tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    3 eggs,
    2 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    1-1/2 or 2 cups of sifted pastry flour.

Cream the butter, stir in the sugar gradually, add the unbeaten eggs,
and beat all together until very creamy. Sift together one-half cup of
the flour, the cocoa and baking powder; use this flour first, then
alternate the milk and remaining flour, using enough to make mixture
stiff enough to drop from the spoon; add vanilla and beat until very
smooth; then bake in loaf in moderately hot oven thirty-five or forty
minutes.

Tests for baking cake. It is baked enough when:
1. It shrinks from the pan.
2. Touching it on the top, springs back.
3. No singing sound.


COCOA MERINGUE PUDDING

    1 cup of milk,
    2 eggs (yolks),
    2 tablespoonfuls of flour,
    Pinch of salt,
    4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    3 tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla.

Put the milk in the upper part of the double-boiler, and heat. Mix flour
and cocoa together and soften in a little cold milk; mix until free
from lumps. When the milk is hot, add the flour, and cook, stirring
often, eight or ten minutes. Beat yolks of eggs lightly; add sugar and
salt, and mix well. When mixture in double-boiler has cooked
sufficiently, strain it over the mixture in the bowl. Put back in
double-boiler and allow it to cook one or two minutes (stirring
constantly), just enough to slightly thicken the eggs. Remove from the
stove, and when cool add vanilla and put in the serving-dish. Cover with
a meringue. Place dish on a board, put in the oven with the door open,
and allow it to remain there for ten or fifteen minutes, and when the
meringue will not stick to the fingers, close the door and let it brown
slightly. This pudding can be eaten warm or cold, but is much better
cold. This will serve four persons generously.


CHOCOLATE ALMONDS

Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water on them, and let them stand
two or three minutes. Roast them in oven. Dip them in the following
recipe for chocolate coating, and drop on paraffine paper.

    1/2 pound cake of Walter Baker's Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,
    2 tablespoonfuls of boiling water.

Put chocolate in small saucepan over boiling water and when melted stir
in butter and water. Mix well. If found to be too thick, add more water;
if too thin, more chocolate.


HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE

    1 cup of boiling water,
    Pinch of salt,
    1 square of chocolate,
    1/2 a cup of sugar.

Cook all together slowly until it is the consistency of maple syrup, or
thicker if desired. Just before serving, add one teaspoonful of vanilla.
This will keep indefinitely, and can be reheated.


COCOA SPONGE CAKE

    4 eggs,
    1/4 a cup of sugar,
    Pinch of salt,
    4 tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,

    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Separate yolks from whites of eggs; beat yolks in a small bowl with the
Dover egg-beater until very thick; add sugar, salt and vanilla, and beat
again until very thick. Sift cocoa and the flour together and stir very
lightly into the mixture; fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs,
and bake in a loaf in a moderate oven until done.

Do not butter the pan, but when cake is baked, invert the pan; and when
cool, remove the cake.


CHOCOLATE FROSTING

    1 square of Baker's Chocolate,
    Pinch of salt,
    5 tablespoonfuls of boiling water,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    About three cups of sifted confectioners' sugar.

Melt chocolate in bowl over tea-kettle, add water, salt and vanilla, and
when smooth add the sugar, and heat until very glossy. Make the frosting
stiff enough to spread without using a wet knife. It will keep
indefinitely.


CHOCOLATE CAKE, OR DEVIL'S FOOD

water. When cooked enough, add the vanilla and beat until it seems like
very cold molasses in winter. Pour into a buttered pan; when firm, cut
in squares. Great care must be taken not to beat too much, because it
cannot be poured into the pan, and will not have a gloss on top.

the mixture boil five minutes, stirring it constantly. Remove from the
fire, add a quart of boiling milk, and serve. If desired a spoonful of
whipped cream may be put in each cup before filling with the cocoa.

The proportions given will make delicious, creamy cocoa, sufficient to
serve twelve persons. The flour should be sifted before it is
measured.--_By Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, author of "The Art of Cookery."_


MRS. EWING'S CREAMY CHOCOLATE

Mix together half a cup of sifted flour, half a cup of granulated sugar
and half a teaspoonful of salt. Put into a saucepan half a cup of Walter
Baker & Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate, finely shaved. Add one quart of
boiling water, stir until dissolved, add the flour, sugar and salt, and
boil gently, stirring constantly, five minutes. Then stir in a quart of
boiling milk, and serve with or without whipped cream.--_Mrs. Emma P.
Ewing, author of "The Art of Cookery."_


MRS. HILL'S COCOA FRAPPÉ

Mix half a pound of cocoa and three cupfuls of sugar; cook with two
cupfuls of boiling water until smooth; add to three quarts and a half of
milk scalded with cinnamon bark; cook for ten minutes. Beat in the
beaten whites of two eggs mixed with a cupful of sugar and a pint of
whipped cream. Cool, flavor with vanilla extract, and freeze. Serve in
cups. Garnish with whipped cream.--_Janet McKenzie Hill--Ladies' Home
Journal._


MRS. HILL'S CHOCOLATE PUFFS

Stir a cupful of flour into a cupful of water and half a cupful of
butter, boiling together; remove from fire, beat in an ounce of melted
chocolate, and, one at a time, three large eggs. Shape with forcing bag
and rose tube. Bake, cut off the tops and put into each cake a
tablespoonful of strawberry preserves. Cover with whipped cream
sweetened and flavored.--_Janet McKenzie Hill--Ladies' Home Journal._


MISS FARMER'S CHOCOLATE CREAM CANDY

    2 cups of sugar,
    2/3 a cup of milk,
    1 tablespoonful of butter,
    2 squares of chocolate,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Put butter into granite saucepan; when melted add sugar and milk. Heat
to boiling point; then add chocolate, and stir constantly until
chocolate is melted. Boil thirteen minutes, remove from fire, add
vanilla, and beat until creamy and mixture begins to sugar slightly
around edge of saucepan. Pour at once into a buttered pan, cool slightly
and mark in squares. Omit vanilla, and add, while cooking, one-fourth of
a teaspoonful of cinnamon.--_Boston Cooking School Cook Book--Fannie
Merritt Farmer._


MRS. SALZBACHER'S CHOCOLATE HEARTS

Melt, by standing over hot water, three ounces of unsweetened chocolate;
add a pound of sifted powdered sugar and mix thoroughly; work to a stiff
yet pliable paste with the unbeaten whites of three eggs (or less),
adding vanilla to flavor. If the paste seems too soft, add more sugar.
Break off in small pieces and roll out about one-fourth of an inch
thick, sprinkling the board and paste with granulated sugar instead of
flour. Cut with a tiny heart-shaped cake cutter (any other small cake
cutter will do), and place on pans oiled just enough to prevent
sticking. Bake in a very moderate oven. When done, they will feel firm
to the touch, a solid crust having formed over the top. They should be
very light, and will loosen easily from the pan after being allowed to
stand a moment to cool. The success of these cakes depends upon the
oven, which should not be as cool as for meringue, nor quite so hot as
for sponge cake. If properly made, they are very excellent and but
little labor. Use the yolks for chocolate whips.--_From "Good
Housekeeping."_


COCOA CHARLOTTE (Without Cream)

    1 pint of water,
    Whites of 2 eggs,
    1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla,
    1/2 a cup of sugar,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,
    1/2 a teaspoonful of cinnamon,
    3 tablespoonfuls of cocoa.

Dissolve the cornstarch in a quarter of a cup of cold water, add it to
the pint of boiling water, stir until it thickens, add the sugar and the
cocoa, which have been thoroughly mixed together. Remove from the fire,
add the cinnamon and vanilla, and pour slowly over the stiffly beaten
whites of eggs. Pour at once into a pudding mould, and put away in a
cold place to harden. Serve with plain cream.--_Mabel Richards Dulon._


CHOCOLATE FUDGE WITH FRUIT

Two cups of sugar, one-half cup of milk, one-half cup of molasses,
one-half cup of butter; mix all together and boil seven minutes; add
one-half cup of Baker's Chocolate and boil seven minutes longer. Then
add two tablespoonfuls of figs, two tablespoonfuls of raisins, one-half
a cup of English walnuts and one teaspoonful of vanilla.


CHOCOLATE MACAROONS

Stir to a paste whites of seven eggs, three-fourths a pound of sifted
sugar, one-half a pound of almonds pounded very fine, and two ounces of
grated Baker's Chocolate. Have ready wafer paper cut round, on which lay
pieces of the mixture rolled to fit the wafer. Press one-half a blanched
almond on each macaroon and bake in a moderate oven.


PETITS FOUR

Bake a simple, light sponge cake in a shallow biscuit tin or dripping
pan, and when cold turn out on the moulding board and cut into small
dominoes or diamonds. They should be about an inch in depth. Split each
one and spread jelly or frosting between the layers, then ice tops and
sides with different tinted icings, pale green flavored with pistachio,
pale pink with rose, yellow with orange, white with almond. Little
domino cakes are also pretty. Ice the cakes on top and sides with white
icing, then when hard put on a second layer of chocolate, using _Walter
Baker & Co.'s Unsweetened Chocolate_ and made as for layer cake, dipping
the brush in the melted chocolate to make the spots.

Candied violets, bits of citron cut in fancy shapes, candied cherries
and angelica may all be utilized in making pretty designs in
decoration.--_American Housekeeper._


POTATO CAKE

Two cups of white sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of hot mashed
potatoes, one cup of chopped walnuts, half a cup of sweet milk, two cups
of flour, four eggs well beaten, five teaspoonfuls of melted chocolate,
one tablespoonful each of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg, two teaspoonfuls
of baking powder. Bake in layers and use marshmallow filling.


SPANISH CHOCOLATE CAKE

One cup of sugar, one-half a cup of butter, one-half a cup of sweet
milk, three cups of flour, two eggs, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved
in hot water. Put on the stove one cup of milk, one-half a cup of
Baker's Chocolate, grated; stir until dissolved; then stir into it one
cup of sugar and the yolk of one egg stirred together; when cool flavor
with vanilla. While this is cooling beat up the first part of the cake
and add the chocolate custard. Bake in layers. Ice on top and between
the layers.



	Dagon (1919)
	by:
	H.P Lovecraft



I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall
be no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes
life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this
garret window into the squalid street below. Do not think from my slavery to
morphine that I am a weakling or a degenerate. When you have read these hastily
scrawled pages you may guess, though never fully realise, why it is that I must
have forgetfulness or death.

It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad Pacific
that the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim to the German sea-raider.
The great war was then at its very beginning, and the ocean forces of the Hun had
not completely sunk to their later degradation; so that our vessel was made a
legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and
consideration due us as naval prisoners. So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of
our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small
boat with water and provisions for a good length of time.

When I finally found myself adrift and free, I had but little idea of my surroundings.
Never a competent navigator, I could only guess vaguely by the sun and stars that I
was somewhat south of the equator. Of the longitude I knew nothing, and no island or
coast-line was in sight. The weather kept fair, and for uncounted days I drifted
aimlessly beneath the scorching sun; waiting either for some passing ship, or to be
cast on the shores of some habitable land. But neither ship nor land appeared, and I
began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastnesses of unbroken blue.
The change happened whilst I slept. Its details I shall never know; for my slumber,
though troubled and dream-infested, was continuous. When at last I awaked, it was to
discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended
about me in monotonous undulations as far as I could see, and in which my boat lay
grounded some distance away.

Though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder at so
prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery, I was in reality more horrified
than astonished; for there was in the air and in the rotting soil a sinister quality
which chilled me to the very core. The region was putrid with the carcasses of
decaying fish, and of other less describable things which I saw protruding from the
nasty mud of the unending plain. Perhaps I should not hope to convey in mere words
the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence and barren immensity.
There was nothing within hearing, and nothing in sight save a vast reach of black slime;
yet the very completeness of the stillness and the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed
me with a nauseating fear.

The sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its cloudless cruelty;
as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet. As I crawled into the stranded boat I
realised that only one theory could explain my position. Through some unprecedented volcanic
upheaval, a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface, exposing regions
which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths.
So great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me, that I could not detect
the faintest noise of the surging ocean, strain my ears as I might. Nor were there any sea-fowl
to prey upon the dead things.

For several hours I sat thinking or brooding in the boat, which lay upon its side and afforded
a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens. As the day progressed, the ground lost some
of its stickiness, and seemed likely to dry sufficiently for travelling purposes in a short time.
That night I slept but little, and the next day I made for myself a pack containing food and
water, preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible rescue.
On the third morning I found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease. The odour of the fish
was maddening; but I was too much concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil,
and set out boldly for an unknown goal. All day I forged steadily westward, guided by a far-away
hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert. That night I encamped,
and on the following day still travelled toward the hummock, though that object seemed scarcely
nearer than when I had first espied it. By the fourth evening I attained the base of the mound,
which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance; an intervening valley
setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface. Too weary to ascend, I slept in the
shadow of the hill.

I know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the waning and fantastically gibbous
moon had risen far above the eastern plain, I was awake in a cold perspiration, determined to
sleep no more. Such visions as I had experienced were too much for me to endure again. And in
the glow of the moon I saw how unwise I had been to travel by day. Without the glare of the
parching sun, my journey would have cost me less energy; indeed, I now felt quite able to perform
the ascent which had deterred me at sunset. Picking up my pack, I started for the crest of the eminence.
I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source of vague horror to me;
but I think my horror was greater when I gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other
side into an immeasurable pit or canyon, whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough
to illumine. I felt myself on the edge of the world; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos
of eternal night. Through my terror ran curious reminiscences of Paradise Lost, and of Satans
hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness.

As the moon climbed higher in the sky, I began to see that the slopes of the valley were not
quite so perpendicular as I had imagined. Ledges and outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy
foot-holds for a descent, whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet, the declivity became very
gradual. Urged on by an impulse which I cannot definitely analyse, I scrambled with difficulty
down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath, gazing into the Stygian deeps where no
light had yet penetrated.

All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the opposite slope,
which rose steeply about an hundred yards ahead of me; an object that gleamed whitely in the
newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon. That it was merely a gigantic piece of stone, I soon
assured myself; but I was conscious of a distinct impression that its contour and position
were not altogether the work of Nature. A closer scrutiny filled me with sensations I cannot express;
for despite its enormous magnitude, and its position in an abyss which had yawned at the bottom
of the sea since the world was young, I perceived beyond a doubt that the strange object was
a well-shaped monolith whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of
living and thinking creatures.

Dazed and frightened, yet not without a certain thrill of the scientists or archaeologists delight,
I examined my surroundings more closely. The moon, now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly
above the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far-flung body of
water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost lapping my feet as
I stood on the slope. Across the chasm, the wavelets washed the base of the Cyclopean monolith; on
whose surface I could now trace both inscriptions and crude sculptures. The writing was in a system
of hieroglyphics unknown to me, and unlike anything I had ever seen in books; consisting for the
most part of conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels, octopi, crustaceans, molluscs,
whales, and the like. Several characters obviously represented marine things which are unknown to
the modern world, but whose decomposing forms I had observed on the ocean-risen plain.

It was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound. Plainly visible
across the intervening water on account of their enormous size, were an array of bas-reliefs
whose subjects would have excited the envy of a Doré. I think that these things were supposed
to depict menat least, a certain sort of men; though the creatures were shewn disporting
like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto, or paying homage at some monolithic shrine
which appeared to be under the waves as well. Of their faces and forms I dare not speak in detail;
for the mere remembrance makes me grow faint. Grotesque beyond the imagination of a Poe or a
Bulwer, they were damnably human in general outline despite webbed hands and feet, shockingly
wide and flabby lips, glassy, bulging eyes, and other features less pleasant to recall. Curiously
enough, they seemed to have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic background;
for one of the creatures was shewn in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger
than himself. I remarked, as I say, their grotesqueness and strange size; but in a moment decided
that they were merely the imaginary gods of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe; some
tribe whose last descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the Piltdown or
Neanderthal Man was born. Awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception
of the most daring anthropologist, I stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the
silent channel before me.

Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing
slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a
stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms,
the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds. I think I went mad then.
Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat,
I remember little. I believe I sang a great deal, and laughed oddly when I was unable to sing. I
have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after I reached the boat; at any rate,
I know that I heard peals of thunder and other tones which Nature utters only in her wildest moods.

When I came out of the shadows I was in a San Francisco hospital; brought thither by the captain of
the American ship which had picked up my boat in mid-ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found
that my words had been given scant attention. Of any land upheaval in the Pacific, my rescuers knew nothing;
nor did I deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which I knew they could not believe. Once I sought
out a celebrated ethnologist, and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient
Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish-God; but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional,
I did not press my inquiries.

It is at night, especially when the moon is gibbous and waning, that I see the thing. I tried morphine;
but the drug has given only transient surcease, and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave.
So now I am to end it all, having written a full account for the information or the contemptuous
amusement of my fellow-men. Often I ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasma mere
freak of fever as I lay sun-stricken and raving in the open boat after my escape from the German man-of-war.
This I ask myself, but ever does there come before me a hideously vivid vision in reply. I cannot think of the
deep sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling and
floundering on its slimy bed, worshipping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable
likenesses on submarine obelisks of water-soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the
billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny, war-exhausted mankindof a day when the
land shall sink, and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemonium.

The end is near. I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it.
It shall not find me. God, that hand! The window! The window!


	The Raven (1845)
	by
	Edgar Allan Poe


Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
"'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;
This it is and nothing more."

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you"here I opened wide the door
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;
'Tis the wind and nothing more.

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as "Nevermore."

But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour
Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered
Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends have flown before
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."
Then the bird said "Nevermore."

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of 'Nevernevermore.'"

But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking "Nevermore."

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee
Respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
On this home by Horror hauntedtell me truly, I implore
Is thereis there balm in Gilead?tell metell me, I implore!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above usby that God we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

"Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be liftednevermore!

	The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1611)



	Chapter: 1

1	The booke of the generation of Iesus Christ, the sonne of Dauid, the sonne of Abraham.
2	Abraham begate Isaac, and Isaac begate Iacob, and Iacob begate Iudas and his brethren.
3	And Iudas begate Phares and Zara of Thamar, and Phares begate Esrom, and Esrom begate Aram.
4	And Aram begate Aminadab, and Aminadab begate Naasson, and Naasson begate Salmon.
5	And Salmon begat Boos of Rachab, and Boos begate Obed of Ruth, and Obed begate Iesse.
6	And Iesse begate Dauid the King, & Dauid the King begat Solomon of her that had bin the wife of Urias.
7	And Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begate Abia, and Abia begate Asa.
8	And Asa begate Iosaphat, and Iosaphat begate Ioram, and Ioram begate Ozias.
9	And Ozias begat Ioatham, and Ioatham begate Achas, and Achas begate Ezekias.
10	And Ezekias begate Manasses, and Manasses begate Amon, and Amon begate Iosias.
11	And Iosias begate Iechonias and his brethren, about the time they were caried away to Babylon.
12	And after they were brought to Babylon, Iechonias begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begate Zorobabel.
13	And Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begate Azor.
14	And Azor begat Sadoc, & Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud.
15	And Eliud begate Eleazar, and Eleazar begate Matthan, and Matthan begate Iacob.
16	And Iacob begate Ioseph the husband of Mary, of whom was borne Iesus, who is called Christ.
17	So all the generations from Abraham to Dauid, are fourteene generations: and from Dauid vntill the carying away into Babylon, are foureteene generations: and from the carying away into Babylon vnto Christ, are fourteene generations.
18	Now the birth of Iesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Ioseph (before they came together) shee was found with childe of the holy Ghost.
19	Then Ioseph her husband being a iust man, and not willing to make her a publique example, was minded to put her away priuily.
20	But while hee thought on these things, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him in a dreame, saying, Ioseph thou sonne of Dauid, feare not to take vnto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceiued in her, is of the holy Ghost.
21	And she shall bring forth a sonne, and thou shalt call his Name Iesus: for hee shall saue his people from their sinnes.
22	(Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying,
23	Behold, a Uirgin shall be with childe, and shall bring foorth a sonne, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted, is, God with vs.)
24	Then Ioseph, being raised from sleepe, did as the Angel of the Lord had bidden him, & tooke vnto him his wife:
25	And knewe her not, till shee had brought forth her first borne sonne, and he called his name Iesus.

	Chapter 2

1	Now when Iesus was borne in Bethlehem of Iudea, in the dayes of Herod the king, behold, there came Wise men from the East to Hierusalem,
2	Saying, Where is he that is borne King of the Iewes? for we haue seene his Starre in the East, and are come to worship him.
3	When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Hierusalem with him.
4	And when he had gathered all the chiefe Priests and Scribes of the people together, hee demanded of them where Christ should be borne.
5	And they said vnto him, In Bethlehem of Iudea: For thus it is written by the Prophet;
6	And thou Bethlehem in the land of Iuda, art not the least among the Princes of Iuda: for out of thee shall come a Gouernour, that shall rule my people Israel.
7	Then Herod, when he had priuily called the Wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the Starre appeared:
8	And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Goe, and search diligently for the yong child, and when ye haue found him, bring me word againe, that I may come and worship him also.
9	When they had heard the King, they departed, and loe, the Starre which they saw in the East, went before them, till it came and stood ouer where the young childe was.
10	When they saw the Starre, they reioyced with exceeding great ioy.
11	And when they were come into the house, they saw the yong child with Mary his mother, and fell downe, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented vnto him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrhe.
12	And being warned of God in a dreame, that they should not returne to Herode, they departed into their owne countrey another way.
13	And when they were departed, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Ioseph in a dreame, saying, Arise and take the young childe, and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and bee thou there vntill I bring thee word: for Herode will seeke the young childe, to destroy him.
14	When he arose, he tooke the yong childe and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
15	And was there vntill the death of Herode, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Out of Egypt haue I called my sonne.
16	Then Herode, when hee saw that hee was mocked of the Wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent foorth, and slewe all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two yeeres olde and vnder, according to the time, which he had diligently enquired of the Wise men.
17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremie the Prophet, saying,
18	In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
19	But when Herode was dead, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeareth in a dreame to Ioseph in Egypt,
20	Saying, Arise, and take the yong childe and his mother, and goe into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the yong childes life.
21	And he arose, and tooke the yong childe and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
22	But when he heard that Archelaus did reigne in Iudea in the roome of his father Herod, hee was afraid to goe thither: notwithstanding, beeing warned of God in a dreame, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
23	And hee came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, He shalbe called a Nazarene.

	Chapter 3

1	In those daies came Iohn the Baptist, preaching in the wildernesse of Iudea,
2	And saying, Repent yee: for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.
3	For this is he that was spoken of by the Prophet Esaias, saying, The voyce of one crying in the wildernes, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
4	And the same Iohn had his raiment of camels haire, and a leatherne girdle about his loynes, and his meate was locusts and wilde hony.
5	Then went out to him Hierusalem, and all Iudea, and all the region round about Iordane,
6	And were baptized of him in Iordane, confessing their sinnes.
7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his Baptisme, he said vnto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
8	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.
9	And thinke not to say within your selues, Wee haue Abraham to our father: For I say vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham.
10	And now also the axe is layd vnto the root of the trees: Therefore euery tree which bringeth not foorth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.
11	I indeed baptize you with water vnto repentance: but he that commeth after mee, is mightier then I, whose shooes I am not worthy to beare, hee shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.
12	Whose fanne is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floore, and gather his wheat into the garner: but wil burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable fire.
13	Then commeth Iesus from Galilee to Iordane, vnto Iohn, to be baptized of him:
14	But Iohn forbade him, saying, I haue need to bee baptized of thee, and commest thou to me?
15	And Iesus answering, said vnto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becommeth vs to fulfill all righteousnesse. Then he suffered him.
16	And Iesus, when hee was baptized, went vp straightway out of the water: and loe, the heauens were opened vnto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a doue, and lighting vpon him.
17	And loe, a voice from heauen, saying, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.

	Chapter 4

1	Then was Iesus led vp of the Spirit into the wildernesse, to bee tempted of the deuill.
2	And when hee had fasted forty dayes and forty nights, hee was afterward an hungred.
3	And when the tempter came to him, hee said, If thou be the sonne of God, command that these stones bee made bread.
4	But he answered, and said, It is written, Man shall not liue by bread alone, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
5	Then the deuill taketh him vp into the holy Citie, and setteth him on a pinacle of the Temple,
6	And saith vnto him, If thou bee the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: For it is written, He shall giue his Angels charge concerning thee, & in their handes they shall beare thee vp, lest at any time thou dash thy foote against a stone.
7	Iesus said vnto him, It is written againe, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
8	Againe the Deuill taketh him vp into an exceeding high mountaine, and sheweth him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them:
9	And saith vnto him, All these things will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me.
10	Then saith Iesus vnto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.
11	Then the deuill leaueth him, and behold, Angels came and ministred vnto him.
12	Now when Iesus had heard that Iohn was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee.
13	And leauing Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is vpon the Sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthali:
14	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,
15	The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthali, by the way of the Sea beyond Iordane, Galilee of the Gentiles:
16	The people which sate in darkenesse, saw great light: and to them which sate in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung vp.
17	From that time Iesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.
18	And Iesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the Sea (for they were fishers)
19	And he saith vnto them, Follow mee: and I will make you fishers of men.
20	And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
21	And going on from thence, hee sawe other two brethren, Iames the sonne of Zebedee, and Iohn his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them.
22	And they immediatly left the shippe and their father, and followed him.
23	And Iesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing all maner of sickenesse, and all maner of disease among the people.
24	And his fame went thorowout all Syria: and they brought vnto him all sicke people that were taken with diuerse diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with deuils, and those which were lunaticke, and those that had the palsie, and he healed them.
25	And there followed him great great multitudes of people, from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Hierusalem, and from Iudea, and from beyond Iordane.

	Chapter 5

1	And seeing the multitudes, he went vp into a mountaine: and when he was set, his disciples came vnto him.
2	And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3	Blessed are the poore in spirit: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.
4	Blessed are they that mourne: for they shall be comforted.
5	Blessed are the meeke: for they shall inherit the earth.
6	Blessed are they which doe hunger and thirst after righteousnesse: for they shall be filled.
7	Blessed are the mercifull: for they shall obtaine mercie.
8	Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9	Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall bee called the children of God.
10	Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnesse sake: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.
11	Blessed are ye, when men shall reuile you, and persecute you, and shal say all manner of euill against you falsly for my sake.
12	Reioyce, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heauen: For so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.
13	Yee are the salt of the earth: But if the salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it bee salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be troden vnder foote of men.
14	Yee are the light of the world. A citie that is set on an hill, cannot be hid.
15	Neither doe men light a candle, and put it vnder a bushell: but on a candlesticke, and it giueth light vnto all that are in the house.
16	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your father which is in heauen.
17	Thinke not that I am come to destroy the lawe or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
18	For verily I say vnto you, Till heauen and earth passe, one iote or one title, shall in no wise passe from the law, till all be fulfilled.
19	Whosoeuer therfore shall breake one of these least commaundements, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdome of heauen: but whosoeuer shall doe, and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen.
20	For I say vnto you, That except your righteousnesse shall exceede the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, yee shall in no case enter into the kingdome of heauen.
21	Yee haue heard, that it was saide by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill: and, Whosoeuer shall kill, shalbe in danger of the iudgement.
22	But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the Iudgement: and whosoeuer shall say to his brother, Racha, shal be in danger of the counsell: but whosoeuer shall say, Thou foole, shalbe in danger of hell fire.
23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee:
24	Leaue there thy gift before the altar, and goe thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
25	Agree with thine aduersarie quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him: least at any time the aduersarie deliuer thee to the iudge, and the iudge deliuer thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
26	Uerily I say vnto thee, thou shalt by no meanes come out thence, till thou hast payd the vttermost farthing.
27	Yee haue heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adulterie.
28	But I say vnto you, That whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart.
29	And if thy right eie offend thee, plucke it out, and cast it from thee. For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
30	And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee. For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
31	It hath beene said, Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, let him giue her a writing of diuorcement.
32	But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, sauing for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoeuer shall marie her that is diuorced, committeth adulterie.
33	Againe, yee haue heard that it hath beene said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe, but shalt performe vnto the Lord thine othes.
34	But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is Gods throne:
35	Nor by the earth, for it is his footstoole: neither by Hierusalem, for it is the citie of the great king.
36	Neither shalt thou sweare by thy head, because thou canst not make one haire white or blacke.
37	But let your communication bee Yea, yea: Nay, nay: For whatsoeuer is more then these, commeth of euill.
38	Yee haue heard that it hath beene said, An eie for an eie, and a tooth for a tooth.
39	But I say vnto you, that yee resist not euill: but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other also.
40	And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him haue thy cloake also.
41	And whosoeuer shall compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.
42	Giue to him that asketh thee: and from him that would borrow of thee, turne not thou away.
43	Yee haue heard, that it hath beene said, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, and hate thine enemie:
44	But I say vnto you, Loue your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully vse you, and persecute you:
45	That yee may be the children of your father which is in heauen: for he maketh his sunne to rise on the euill and on the good, and sendeth raine on the iust, and on the vniust.
46	For if yee loue them which loue you, what reward haue yee? Doe not euen the Publicanes the same?
47	And if yee salute your brethren only, what do you more then others? Doe not euen the Publicanes so?
48	Be yee therefore perfect, euen as your father, which is in heauen, is perfect.

	Chapter 6

1	Take heed that yee doe not your almes before men, to bee seene of them: otherwise yee haue no reward of your father which is in heauen.
2	Therefore, when thou doest thine almes, doe not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites doe, in the Synagogues, and in the streetes, that they may haue glory of men. Uerily, I say vnto you, they haue their reward.
3	But when thou doest almes, let not thy left hand know, what thy right doeth:
4	That thine almes may be in secret: And thy father which seeth in secret, himselfe shall reward thee openly.
5	And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they loue to pray standing in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seene of men. Uerily I say vnto you, they haue their reward.
6	But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy doore, pray to thy father which is in secret, and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
7	But when yee pray, vse not vaine repetitions, as the heathen doe. For they thinke that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
8	Be not yee therefore like vnto them: For your father knoweth what things yee haue neede of, before yee aske him.
9	After this maner therefore pray yee: Our father which art in heauen, hallowed be thy name.
10	Thy kingdome come. Thy will be done, in earth, as it is in heauen.
11	Giue vs this day our daily bread.
12	And forgiue vs our debts, as we forgiue our debters.
13	And lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill: For thine is the kingdome, and the power, and the glory, for euer, Amen.
14	For, if yee forgiue men their trespasses, your heauenly father will also forgiue you.
15	But, if yee forgiue not men their trespasses, neither will your father forgiue your trespasses.
16	Moreouer, when yee fast, be not as the Hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appeare vnto men to fast: Uerily I say vnto you, they haue their reward.
17	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face:
18	That thou appeare not vnto men to fast, but vnto thy father which is in secret: and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
19	Lay not vp for your selues treasures vpon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where theeues breake thorow, and steale.
20	But lay vp for your selues treasures in heauen, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, & where theeues doe not breake thorow, nor steale.
21	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
22	The light of the body is the eye: If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shalbe full of light.
23	But if thine eye be euill, thy whole body shall be full of darknesse. If therfore the light that is in thee be darkenesse, how great is that darkenesse?
24	No man can serue two masters: for either he will hate the one and loue the other, or else hee will holde to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serue God and Mammon.
25	Therfore I say vnto you, Take no thought for your life, what yee shall eate, or what ye shall drinke, nor yet for your body, what yee shall put on: Is not the life more then meate? and the body then raiment?
26	Behold the foules of the aire: for they sow not, neither do they reape, nor gather into barnes, yet your heauenly father feedeth them. Are yee not much better then they?
27	Which of you by taking thought, can adde one cubite vnto his stature?
28	And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lillies of the field, how they grow: they toile not, neither doe they spinne.
29	And yet I say vnto you, that euen Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed like one of these.
30	Wherefore, if God so clothe the grasse of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the ouen: shall he not much more clothe you, O yee of little faith?
31	Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eate? or, what shall we drinke? or wherewithall shall wee be clothed?
32	(For after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke:) for your heauenly father knoweth that ye haue neede of all these things.
33	But seeke ye first the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shalbe added vnto you.
34	Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of it selfe: sufficient vnto the day is the euill thereof.



	A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act I(1605)
	by:
	William Shakespeare



ACT I
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.

    Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants 

THESEUS

    Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
    Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
    Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
    This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
    Like to a step-dame or a dowager
    Long withering out a young man revenue.

HIPPOLYTA

    Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
    Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
    And then the moon, like to a silver bow
    New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
    Of our solemnities.

THESEUS

    Go, Philostrate,
    Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
    Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
    Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
    The pale companion is not for our pomp.

    Exit PHILOSTRATE
    Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
    And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
    But I will wed thee in another key,
    With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.

    Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS

EGEUS

    Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!

THESEUS

    Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?

EGEUS

    Full of vexation come I, with complaint
    Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
    Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
    This man hath my consent to marry her.
    Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
    This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
    Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
    And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
    Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
    With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
    And stolen the impression of her fantasy
    With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
    Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
    Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
    With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
    Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
    To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
    Be it so she; will not here before your grace
    Consent to marry with Demetrius,
    I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
    As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
    Which shall be either to this gentleman
    Or to her death, according to our law
    Immediately provided in that case.

THESEUS

    What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
    To you your father should be as a god;
    One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
    To whom you are but as a form in wax
    By him imprinted and within his power
    To leave the figure or disfigure it.
    Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

HERMIA

    So is Lysander.

THESEUS

    In himself he is;
    But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
    The other must be held the worthier.

HERMIA

    I would my father look'd but with my eyes.

THESEUS

    Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

HERMIA

    I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
    I know not by what power I am made bold,
    Nor how it may concern my modesty,
    In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
    But I beseech your grace that I may know
    The worst that may befall me in this case,
    If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

THESEUS

    Either to die the death or to abjure
    For ever the society of men.
    Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
    Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
    Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
    You can endure the livery of a nun,
    For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
    To live a barren sister all your life,
    Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
    Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
    To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
    But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
    Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
    Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

HERMIA

    So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
    Ere I will my virgin patent up
    Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
    My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

THESEUS

    Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--
    The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
    For everlasting bond of fellowship--
    Upon that day either prepare to die
    For disobedience to your father's will,
    Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
    Or on Diana's altar to protest
    For aye austerity and single life.

DEMETRIUS

    Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
    Thy crazed title to my certain right.

LYSANDER

    You have her father's love, Demetrius;
    Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.

EGEUS

    Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
    And what is mine my love shall render him.
    And she is mine, and all my right of her
    I do estate unto Demetrius.

LYSANDER

    I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
    As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
    My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
    If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
    And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
    I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
    Why should not I then prosecute my right?
    Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
    Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
    And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
    Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
    Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

THESEUS

    I must confess that I have heard so much,
    And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
    But, being over-full of self-affairs,
    My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
    And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
    I have some private schooling for you both.
    For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
    To fit your fancies to your father's will;
    Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
    Which by no means we may extenuate--
    To death, or to a vow of single life.
    Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
    Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
    I must employ you in some business
    Against our nuptial and confer with you
    Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

EGEUS

    With duty and desire we follow you.

    Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA

LYSANDER

    How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
    How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

HERMIA

    Belike for want of rain, which I could well
    Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

LYSANDER

    Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
    Could ever hear by tale or history,
    The course of true love never did run smooth;
    But, either it was different in blood,--

HERMIA

    O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

LYSANDER

    Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--

HERMIA

    O spite! too old to be engaged to young.

LYSANDER

    Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--

HERMIA

    O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.

LYSANDER

    Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
    War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
    Making it momentany as a sound,
    Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
    Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
    That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
    And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
    The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
    So quick bright things come to confusion.

HERMIA

    If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
    It stands as an edict in destiny:
    Then let us teach our trial patience,
    Because it is a customary cross,
    As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
    Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

LYSANDER

    A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
    I have a widow aunt, a dowager
    Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
    From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
    And she respects me as her only son.
    There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
    And to that place the sharp Athenian law
    Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
    Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
    And in the wood, a league without the town,
    Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
    To do observance to a morn of May,
    There will I stay for thee.

HERMIA

    My good Lysander!
    I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
    By his best arrow with the golden head,
    By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
    By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
    And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
    When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
    By all the vows that ever men have broke,
    In number more than ever women spoke,
    In that same place thou hast appointed me,
    To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.

LYSANDER

    Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

    Enter HELENA

HERMIA

    God speed fair Helena! whither away?

HELENA

    Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
    Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
    Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
    More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
    When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
    Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
    Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
    My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
    My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
    Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
    The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
    O, teach me how you look, and with what art
    You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

HERMIA

    I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

HELENA

    O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

HERMIA

    I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

HELENA

    O that my prayers could such affection move!

HERMIA

    The more I hate, the more he follows me.

HELENA

    The more I love, the more he hateth me.

HERMIA

    His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

HELENA

    None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!

HERMIA

    Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
    Lysander and myself will fly this place.
    Before the time I did Lysander see,
    Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
    O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
    That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!

LYSANDER

    Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
    To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
    Her silver visage in the watery glass,
    Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
    A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
    Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.

HERMIA

    And in the wood, where often you and I
    Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
    Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
    There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
    And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
    To seek new friends and stranger companies.
    Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
    And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
    Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
    From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

LYSANDER

    I will, my Hermia.

    Exit HERMIA
    Helena, adieu:
    As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!

    Exit

HELENA

    How happy some o'er other some can be!
    Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
    But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
    He will not know what all but he do know:
    And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
    So I, admiring of his qualities:
    Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
    Love can transpose to form and dignity:
    Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
    And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
    Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
    Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
    And therefore is Love said to be a child,
    Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
    As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
    So the boy Love is perjured every where:
    For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
    He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
    And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
    So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
    I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
    Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
    Pursue her; and for this intelligence
    If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
    But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
    To have his sight thither and back again.

    Exit

SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.

    Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING 

QUINCE

    Is all our company here?

BOTTOM

    You were best to call them generally, man by man,
    according to the scrip.

QUINCE

    Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
    thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
    interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
    wedding-day at night.

BOTTOM

    First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
    on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
    to a point.

QUINCE

    Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
    most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.

BOTTOM

    A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
    merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
    actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

QUINCE

    Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.

BOTTOM

    Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.

QUINCE

    You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

BOTTOM

    What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?

QUINCE

    A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.

BOTTOM

    That will ask some tears in the true performing of
    it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
    eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
    measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
    tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
    tear a cat in, to make all split.
    The raging rocks
    And shivering shocks
    Shall break the locks
    Of prison gates;
    And Phibbus' car
    Shall shine from far
    And make and mar
    The foolish Fates.
    This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
    This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
    more condoling.

QUINCE

    Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.

FLUTE

    Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE

    Flute, you must take Thisby on you.

FLUTE

    What is Thisby? a wandering knight?

QUINCE

    It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

FLUTE

    Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.

QUINCE

    That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
    you may speak as small as you will.

BOTTOM

    An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
    speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
    Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
    and lady dear!'

QUINCE

    No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.

BOTTOM

    Well, proceed.

QUINCE

    Robin Starveling, the tailor.

STARVELING

    Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE

    Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
    Tom Snout, the tinker.

SNOUT

    Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE

    You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
    Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
    hope, here is a play fitted.

SNUG

    Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
    be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

QUINCE

    You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

BOTTOM

    Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
    do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
    that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
    let him roar again.'

QUINCE

    An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
    the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
    and that were enough to hang us all.

ALL

    That would hang us, every mother's son.

BOTTOM

    I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
    ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
    discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
    voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
    sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
    nightingale.

QUINCE

    You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
    sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
    summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
    therefore you must needs play Pyramus.

BOTTOM

    Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
    to play it in?

QUINCE

    Why, what you will.

BOTTOM

    I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
    beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
    beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
    perfect yellow.

QUINCE

    Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
    then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
    are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
    you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
    and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
    town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
    we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
    company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
    will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
    wants. I pray you, fail me not.

BOTTOM

    We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
    obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.

QUINCE

    At the duke's oak we meet.

BOTTOM

    Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.

    Exeunt

	Genesis Chapter: 1



1	In the bigynnyng God made of nouyt heuene and erthe.
2	Forsothe the erthe was idel and voide, and derknessis weren on the face of depthe; and the Spiryt of the Lord was borun on the watris.
3	And God seide, Liyt be maad, and liyt was maad.
4	And God seiy the liyt, that it was good, and he departide the liyt fro derknessis; and he clepide the liyt,
5	dai, and the derknessis, nyyt. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, o daie.
6	And God seide, The firmament be maad in the myddis of watris, and departe watris fro watris.
7	And God made the firmament, and departide the watris that weren vndur the firmament fro these watris that weren on the firmament; and it was don so.
8	And God clepide the firmament, heuene. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the secounde dai.
9	Forsothe God seide, The watris, that ben vndur heuene, be gaderid in to o place, and a drie place appere; and it was doon so.
10	And God clepide the drie place, erthe; and he clepide the gadryngis togidere of watris, the sees. And God seiy that it was good;
11	and seide, The erthe brynge forth greene eerbe and makynge seed, and appil tre makynge fruyt bi his kynde, whos seed be in it silf on erthe; and it was doon so.
12	And the erthe brouyte forth greene erbe and makynge seed bi his kynde, and a tre makynge fruyt, and ech hauynge seed by his kynde. And God seiy that it was good.
13	And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the thridde dai.
14	Forsothe God seide, Liytis be maad in the firmament of heuene, and departe tho the dai and niyt; and be tho in to signes, and tymes, and daies, and yeeris;
15	and shyne tho in the firmament of heuene, and liytne tho the erthe; and it was doon so.
16	And God made twei grete liytis, the gretter liyt that it schulde be bifore to the dai, and the lesse liyt that it schulde be bifore to the niyt;
17	and God made sterris; and settide tho in the firmament of heuene, that tho schulden schyne on erthe,
18	and that tho schulden be bifore to the dai and nyyt, and schulden departe liyt and derknesse. And God seiy that it was good.
19	And the euentid and the morwetid was maad, the fourthe dai.
20	Also God seide, The watris brynge forth a `crepynge beeste of lyuynge soule, and a brid fleynge aboue erthe vndur the firmament of heuene.
21	And God made of nouyt grete whallis, and ech lyuynge soule and mouable, whiche the watris han brouyt forth in to her kyndis; and God made of nouyt ech volatile bi his kynde. And God seiy that it was good;
22	and blesside hem, and seide, Wexe ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the watris of the see, and briddis be multiplied on erthe.
23	And the euentid and the morwetid was maad, the fyuethe dai.
24	And God seide, The erthe brynge forth a lyuynge soul in his kynde, werk beestis, and `crepynge beestis, and vnresonable beestis of erthe, bi her kyndis; and it was don so.
25	And God made vnresonable beestis of erthe bi her kyndes, and werk beestis, `and ech crepynge beeste of erthe in his kynde. And God seiy that it was good; and seide,
26	Make we man to oure ymage and liknesse, and be he souereyn to the fischis of the see, and to the volatilis of heuene, and to vnresonable beestis of erthe, and to ech creature, and to ech `crepynge beest, which is moued in erthe.
27	And God made of nouyt a man to his ymage and liknesse; God made of nouyt a man, to the ymage of God; God made of nouyt hem, male and female.
28	And God blesside hem, and seide, Encreesse ye, and be ye multiplied, and fille ye the erthe, and make ye it suget, and be ye lordis to fischis of the see, and to volatilis of heuene, and to alle lyuynge beestis that ben moued on erthe.
29	And God seide, Lo! Y haue youe to you ech eerbe berynge seed on erthe, and alle trees that han in hem silf the seed of her kynde, that tho be in to mete to you;
30	and to alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, and to ech brid of heuene, and to alle thingis that ben moued in erthe, and in whiche is a lyuynge soule, that tho haue to ete; and it was doon so.
31	And God seiy alle thingis whiche he made, and tho weren ful goode. And the euentid and morwetid was maad, the sixte day.

	Genesis Chapter: 2
1	Therfor heuenes and erthe ben maad perfit, and al the ournement of tho.
2	And God fillide in the seuenthe dai his werk which he made; and he restide in the seuenthe dai fro al his werk which he hadde maad;
3	and he blesside the seuenthe dai, and halewide it; for in that dai God ceesside of al his werk which he made of nouyt, that he schulde make.
4	These ben the generaciouns of heuene and of erthe, in the day wherynne the Lord God made heuene and erthe,
5	and ech litil tre of erthe bifore that it sprong out in erthe; and he made ech erbe of the feeld bifore that it buriownede. For the Lord God had not reyned on erthe, and no man was that wrouyte erthe;
6	but a welle stiede out of the erthe, and moistide al the hiyere part of erthe.
7	Therfor the Lord God formede man of the sliym of erthe, and brethide in to his face the brething of lijf; and man was maad in to a lyuynge soule.
8	Forsothe the Lord God plauntide at the bigynnyng paradis of likyng, wherynne he settide man whom he hadde formed.
9	And the Lord God brouyte forth of the erthe ech tre fair in siyt, and swete to ete; also he brouyte forth the tre of lijf in the middis of paradis, and the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel.
10	And a ryuer yede out fro the place of likyng to moyste paradis, which ryuer is departid fro thennus in to foure heedis.
11	The name of the o ryuer is Fyson, thilke it is that cumpassith al the lond of Euilath, where gold cometh forth,
12	and the gold of that lond is the beste, and there is foundun delium, that is, a tree of spicerie, and the stoon onychyn;
13	and the name to the secounde ryuer is Gyon, thilke it is that cumpassith al the loond of Ethiopie;
14	forsothe the name of the thridde ryuer is Tigris, thilke goith ayens Assiriens; sotheli the fourthe ryuer is thilke Eufrates.
15	Therfor the Lord God took man, and settide hym in paradis of likyng, that he schulde worche and kepe it.
16	And God comaundide to hym and seide, Ete thou of ech tre of paradis;
17	forsothe ete thou not of the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel; for in what euere dai thou schalt ete therof, thou schalt die bi deeth.
18	And the Lord God seide, It is not good that a man be aloone, make we to hym an help lijk to hym silf.
19	Therfor whanne alle lyuynge beestis of erthe, and alle the volatils of heuene weren formed of erthe, the Lord God brouyte tho to Adam, that he schulde se what he schulde clepe tho; for al thing that Adam clepide of lyuynge soule, thilke is the name therof.
20	And Adam clepide bi her names alle lyuynge thingis, and alle volatils, and alle vnresonable beestis of erthe. Forsothe to Adam was not foundun an helpere lijk hym.
21	Therfore the Lord God sente sleep in to Adam, and whanne he slepte, God took oon of hise ribbis, and fillide fleisch for it.
22	And the Lord God bildide the rib which he hadde take fro Adam in to a womman, and brouyte hir to Adam.
23	And Adam seide, This is now a boon of my boonys, and fleisch of my fleisch; this schal be clepid virago, `for she is takun of man.
24	Wherfor a man schal forsake fadir and modir, and schal cleue to his wijf, and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
25	Forsothe euer eithir was nakid, that is, Adam and his wijf, and thei weren not aschamed.

	The First Oration Against Catiline
	by:
	Cicero


Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?  quam diu etiam
furor iste tuus nos eludet?  quem ad finem sese effrenata iactabit
audacia?  Nihilne te nocturnum praesidium Palati, nihil urbis vigiliae,
nihil timor populi, nihil concursus bonorum omnium, nihil hic munitissimus
habendi senatus locus, nihil horum ora voltusque moverunt?  Patere tua
consilia non sentis, constrictam iam horum omnium scientia teneri
coniurationem tuam non vides?  Quid proxima, quid superiore nocte egeris,
ubi fueris, quos convocaveris, quid consilii ceperis, quem nostrum
ignorare arbitraris?  O tempora, o mores! Senatus haec intellegit.  consul
videt; hic tamen vivit.  Vivit?  immo vero etiam in senatum venit, fit
publici consilii particeps, notat et designat oculis ad caedem unum
quemque nostrum.  Nos autem fortes viri satis facere rei publicae videmur,
si istius furorem ac tela vitemus.  Ad mortem te, Catilina, duci iussu
consulis iam pridem oportebat, in te conferri pestem, quam tu in nos
[omnes iam diu] machinaris.  An vero vir amplissumus, P. Scipio, pontifex
maximus, Ti.  Gracchum mediocriter labefactantem statum rei publicae
privatus interfecit; Catilinam orbem terrae caede atque incendiis vastare
cupientem nos consules perferemus?  Nam illa nimis antiqua praetereo, quod
C. Servilius Ahala Sp.  Maelium novis rebus studentem manu sua occidit.
Fuit, fuit ista quondam in hac re publica virtus, ut viri fortes
acrioribus suppliciis civem perniciosum quam acerbissimum hostem
coercerent.  Habemus senatus consultum in te, Catilina, vehemens et grave,
non deest rei publicae consilium neque auctoritas huius ordinis; nos, nos,
dico aperte, consules desumus.  Decrevit quondam senatus, ut L. Opimius
consul videret, ne quid res publica detrimenti caperet; nox nulla
intercessit; interfectus est propter quasdam seditionum suspiciones
C. Gracchus, clarissimo patre, avo, maioribus, occisus est cum liberis
M. Fulvius consularis.  Simili senatus consulto C. Mario et L.  Valerio
consulibus est permissa res publica; num unum diem postea L. Saturninum
tribunum pl.  et C.  Servilium praetorem mors ac rei publicae poena
remorata est?  At [vero] nos vicesimum iam diem patimur hebescere aciem
horum auctoritatis.  Habemus enim huiusce modi senatus consultum, verum
inclusum in tabulis tamquam in vagina reconditum, quo ex senatus consulto
confestim te interfectum esse, Catilina, convenit.  Vivis, et vivis non ad
deponendam, sed ad confirmandam audaciam.  Cupio, patres conscripti, me
esse clementem, cupio in tantis rei publicae periculis me non dissolutum
videri, sed iam me ipse inertiae nequitiaeque condemno.  Castra sunt in
Italia contra populum Romanum in Etruriae faucibus conlocata, crescit in
dies singulos hostium numerus; eorum autem castrorum imperatorem ducemque
hostium intra moenia atque adeo in senatu videmus intestinam aliquam
cotidie perniciem rei publicae molientem.  Si te iam, Catilina,
comprehendi, si interfici iussero, credo, erit verendum mihi, ne non
potius hoc omnes boni serius a me quam quisquam crudelius factum esse
dicat.  Verum ego hoc, quod iam pridem factum esse oportuit, certa de
causa nondum adducor ut faciam.  Tum denique interficiere, cum iam nemo
tam inprobus, tam perditus, tam tui similis inveniri poterit, qui id non
iure factum esse fateatur.  Quamdiu quisquam erit, qui te defendere
audeat, vives, et vives ita, ut [nunc] vivis.  multis meis et firmis
praesidiis obsessus, ne commovere te contra rem publicam possis.  Multorum
te etiam oculi et aures non sentientem, sicut adhuc fecerunt,
speculabuntur atque custodient.

Etenim quid est, Catilina, quod iam amplius expectes, si neque nox
tenebris obscurare coeptus nefarios nec privata domus parietibus continere
voces coniurationis tuae potest, si illustrantur, si erumpunt omnia?  Muta
iam istam mentem, mihi crede, obliviscere caedis atque incendiorum.
Teneris undique; luce sunt clariora nobis tua consilia omnia; quae iam
mecum licet recognoscas.  Meministine me ante diem XII Kalendas Novembris
dicere in senatu fore in armis certo die, qui dies futurus esset ante diem
VI Kal.  Novembris, C. Manlium, audaciae satellitem atque administrum
tuae?  Num me fefellit, Catilina, non modo res tanta, tam atrox tamque
incredibilis, verum, id quod multo magis est admirandum, dies?  Dixi ego
idem in senatu caedem te optumatium contulisse in ante diem V Kalendas
Novembris, tum cum multi principes civitatis Roma non tam sui conservandi
quam tuorum consiliorum reprimendorum causa profugerunt.  Num infitiari
potes te illo ipso die meis praesidiis, mea diligentia circumclusum
commovere te contra rem publicam non potuisse, cum tu discessu ceterorum
nostra tamen, qui remansissemus, caede te contentum esse dicebas?  Quid?
cum te Praeneste Kalendis ipsis Novembribus occupaturum nocturno impetu
esse confideres, sensistin illam coloniam meo iussu meis praesidiis,
custodiis, vigiliis esse munitam?  Nihil agis, nihil moliris, nihil
cogitas, quod non ego non modo audiam, sed etiam videam planeque sentiam.
Recognosce tandem mecum noctem illam superiorem; iam intelleges multo me
vigilare acrius ad salutem quam te ad perniciem rei publicae.  Dico te
priore nocte venisse inter falcarios (non agam obscure) in M. Laecae
domum; convenisse eodem complures eiusdem amentiae scelerisque socios.
Num negare audes?  quid taces?  Convincam, si negas.  Video enim esse hic
in senatu quosdam, qui tecum una fuerunt.  O di inmortales! ubinam gentium
sumus?  in qua urbe vivimus?  quam rem publicam habemus?  Hic, hic sunt in
nostro numero, patres conscripti, in hoc orbis terrae sanctissimo
gravissimoque consilio, qui de nostro omnium interitu, qui de huius urbis
atque adeo de orbis terrarum exitio cogitent! Hos ego video consul et de
re publica sententiam rogo et, quos ferro trucidari oportebat, eos nondum
voce volnero! Fuisti igitur apud Laecam illa nocte, Catilina, distribuisti
partes Italiae, statuisti, quo quemque proficisci placeret, delegisti,
quos Romae relinqueres, quos tecum educeres, discripsisti urbis partes ad
incendia, confirmasti te ipsum iam esse exiturum, dixisti paulum tibi esse
etiam nunc morae, quod ego viverem.  Reperti sunt duo equites Romani, qui
te ista cura liberarent et sese illa ipsa nocte paulo ante lucem me in meo
lectulo interfecturos [esse] pollicerentur.  Haec ego omnia vixdum etiam
coetu vestro dimisso comperi; domum meam maioribus praesidiis munivi atque
firmavi, exclusi eos, quos tu ad me salutatum mane miseras, cum illi ipsi
venissent, quos ego iam multis ac summis viris ad me id temporis venturos
esse praedixeram.

Quae cum ita sint, Catilina, perge, quo coepisti, egredere aliquando
ex urbe; patent portae; proficiscere.  Nimium diu te imperatorem tua illa
Manliana castra desiderant.  Educ tecum etiam omnes tuos, si minus, quam
plurimos; purga urbem.  Magno me metu liberabis, dum modo inter me atque
te murus intersit.  Nobiscum versari iam diutius non potes; non feram, non
patiar, non sinam.  Magna dis inmortalibus habenda est atque huic ipsi
Iovi Statori, antiquissimo custodi huius urbis, gratia, quod hanc tam
taetram, tam horribilem tamque infestam rei publicae pestem totiens iam
effugimus.  Non est saepius in uno homine summa salus periclitanda rei
publicae.  Quamdiu mihi consuli designato, Catilina, insidiatus es, non
publico me praesidio, sed privata diligentia defendi.  Cum proximis
comitiis consularibus me consulem in campo et competitores tuos
interficere voluisti, compressi conatus tuos nefarios amicorum praesidio
et copiis nullo tumultu publice concitato; denique, quotienscumque me
petisti, per me tibi obstiti, quamquam videbam perniciem meam cum magna
calamitate rei publicae esse coniunctam.  Nunc iam aperte rem publicam
universam petis, templa deorum inmortalium, tecta urbis, vitam omnium
civium, Italiam [denique] totam ad exitium et vastitatem vocas.  Quare,
quoniam id, quod est primum, et quod huius imperii disciplinaeque maiorum
proprium est, facere nondum audeo, faciam id, quod est ad severitatem
lenius et ad communem salutem utilius.  Nam si te interfici iussero,
residebit in re publica reliqua coniuratorum manus; sin tu, quod te iam
dudum hortor, exieris, exhaurietur ex urbe tuorum comitum magna et
perniciosa sentina rei publicae.  Quid est, Catilina?  num dubitas id me
imperante facere, quod iam tua sponte faciebas?  Exire ex urbe iubet
consul hostem.  Interrogas me, num in exilium; non iubeo, sed, si me
consulis, suadeo.  Quid est enim, Catilina, quod te iam in hac urbe
delectare possit?  in qua nemo est extra istam coniurationem perditorum
hominum, qui te non metuat, nemo, qui non oderit.  Quae nota domesticae
turpitudinis non inusta vitae tuae est?  quod privatarum rerum dedecus non
haeret in fama?  quae lubido ab oculis, quod facinus a manibus umquam
tuis, quod flagitium a toto corpore afuit?  cui tu adulescentulo, quem
corruptelarum inlecebris inretisses, non aut ad audaciam ferrum aut ad
lubidinem facem praetulisti?  Quid vero?  nuper cum morte superioris
uxoris novis nuptiis domum vacuefecisses, nonne etiam alio incredibili
scelere hoc scelus cumulasti?  quod ego praetermitto et facile patior
sileri, ne in hac civitate tanti facinoris inmanitas aut extitisse aut non
vindicata esse videatur Praetermitto ruinas fortunarum tuarum, quas omnis
inpendere tibi proxumis Idibus senties; ad illa venio, quae non ad
privatam ignominiam vitiorum tuorum, non ad domesticam tuam difficultatem
ac turpitudinem sed ad summam rem publicam atque ad omnium nostrum vitam
salutemque pertinent.  Potestne tibi haec lux, Catilina, aut huius caeli
spiritus esse iucundus, cum scias esse horum neminem, qui nesciat te
pridie Kalendas Ianuarias Lepido et Tullo consulibus stetisse in comitio
cum telo, manum consulum et principum civitatis interficiendorum causa
paravisse, sceleri ac furori tuo non mentem aliquam aut timorem tuum sed
fortunam populi Romani obstitisse?  Ac iam illa omitto (neque enim sunt
aut obscura aut non multa commissa postea); quotiens tu me designatum,
quotiens consulem interficere conatus es! quot ego tuas petitiones ita
coniectas, ut vitari posse non viderentur, parva quadam declinatione et,
ut aiunt, corpore effugi! nihil [agis, nihil] adsequeris [, nihil moliris]
neque tamen conari ac velle desistis.  Quotiens tibi iam extorta est ista
sica de manibus, quotiens [vero] excidit casu aliquo et elapsa est! [tamen
ea carere diutius non potes] quae quidem quibus abs te initiata sacris ac
devota sit, nescio, quod eam necesse putas esse in consulis corpore
defigere.  Nunc vero quae tua est ista vita?  Sic enim iam tecum loquar,
non ut odio permotus esse videar, quo debeo, sed ut misericordia, quae
tibi nulla debetur.  Venisti paulo ante in senatum.  Quis te ex hac tanta
frequentia totque tuis amicis ac necessariis salutavit?  Si hoc post
hominum memoriam contigit nemini, vocis expectas contumeliam, cum sis
gravissimo iudicio taciturnitatis oppressus?  Quid, quod adventu tuo ista
subsellia vacuefacta sunt, quod omnes consulares, qui tibi persaepe ad
caedem constituti fuerunt, simul atque adsedisti, partem istam
subselliorum nudam atque inanem reliquerunt, quo tandem animo [hoc] tibi
ferundum putas?  Servi mehercule mei si me isto pacto metuerent, ut te
metuunt omnes cives tui, domum meam relinquendam putarem; tu tibi urbem
non arbitraris?  et, si me meis civibus iniuria suspectum tam graviter
atque offensum viderem, carere me aspectu civium quam infestis omnium
oculis conspici mallem; tu cum conscientia scelerum tuorum agnoscas odium
omnium iustum et iam diu tibi debitum, dubitas, quorum mentes sensusque
volneras, eorum aspectum praesentiamque vitare?  Si te parentes timerent
atque odissent tui neque eos ulla ratione placare posses, ut opinor, ab
eorum oculis aliquo concederes.  Nunc te patria, quae communis est parens
omnium nostrum, odit ac metuit et iam diu nihil te iudicat nisi de
parricidio suo cogitare; huius tu neque auctoritatem verebere nec iudicium
sequere nec vim pertimesces?  Quae tecum, Catilina, sic agit et quodam
modo tacita loquitur:  `Nullum iam aliquot annis facinus exstitit nisi per
te, nullum flagitium sine te; tibi uni multorum civium neces, tibi vexatio
direptioque sociorum inpunita fuit ac libera; tu non solum ad neglegendas
leges et quaestiones, verum etiam ad evertendas perfringendasque valuisti.
 Superiora illa, quamquam ferenda non fuerunt, tamen, ut potui, tuli; nunc
vero me totam esse in metu propter unum te, quicquid increpuerit,
Catilinam timeri, nullum videri contra me consilium iniri posse, quod a
tuo scelere abhorreat, non est ferendum.  Quam ob rem discede atque hunc
mihi timorem eripe; si est verus, ne opprimar, sin falsus, ut tandem
aliquando timere desinam.' Haec si tecum, ita ut dixi, patria loquatur,
nonne impetrare debeat, etiamsi vim adhibere non possit?  Quid, quod tu te
ipse in custodiam dedisti, quod vitandae suspicionis causa ad M'.  Lepidum
te habitare velle dixisti?  A quo non receptus etiam ad me venire ausus es
atque, ut domi meae te adservarem, rogasti.  Cum a me quoque id responsum
tulisses, me nullo modo posse isdem parietibus tuto esse tecum, qui magno
in periculo essem, quod isdem moenibus contineremur, ad Q. Metellum
praetorem venisti.  A quo repudiatus ad sodalem tuum, virum optumum, M.
Metellum, demigrasti; quem tu videlicet et ad custodiendum diligentissimum
et ad suspicandum sagacissimum et ad vindicandum fortissimum fore putasti.
 Sed quam longe videtur a carcere atque a vinculis abesse debere, qui se
ipse iam dignum custodia iudicarit! Quae cum ita sint, Catilina, dubitas,
si emori aequo animo non potes, abire in aliquas terras et vitam istam
multis suppliciis iustis debitisque ereptam fugae solitudinique mandare?

`Refer', inquis, `ad senatum'; id enim postulas et, si hic ordo [sibi]
placere decreverit te ire in exilium, optemperaturum te esse dicis.  Non
referam, id quod abhorret a meis moribus, et tamen faciam, ut intellegas,
quid hi de te sentiant.  Egredere ex urbe, Catilina, libera rem publicam
metu, in exilium, si hanc vocem exspectas, proficiscere.  Quid est,
Catilina?  ecquid attendis, ecquid animadvertis horum silentium?
Patiuntur, tacent.  Quid exspectas auctoritatem loquentium, quorum
voluntatem tacitorum perspicis?  At si hoc idem huic adulescenti optimo,
P. Sestio, si fortissimo viro, M. Marcello, dixissem, iam mihi consuli hoc
ipso in templo iure optimo senatus vim et manus intulisset.  De te autem,
Catilina, cum quiescunt, probant, cum patiuntur, decernunt, cum tacent,
clamant, neque hi solum, quorum tibi auctoritas est videlicet cara, vita
vilissima, sed etiam illi equites Romani, honestissimi atque optimi viri,
ceterique fortissimi cives, qui circumstant senatum, quorum tu et
frequentiam videre et studia perspicere et voces paulo ante exaudire
potuisti.  Quorum ego vix abs te iam diu manus ac tela contineo, eosdem
facile adducam, ut te haec, quae vastare iam pridem studes, relinquentem
usque ad portas prosequantur.

Quamquam quid loquor?  te ut ulla res frangat, tu ut umquam te
corrigas, tu ut ullam fugam meditere, tu ut ullum exilium cogites?  Utinam
tibi istam mentem di inmortales duint! tametsi video, si mea voce
perterritus ire in exilium animum induxeris quanta tempestas invidiae
nobis, si minus in praesens tempus recenti memoria scelerum tuorum, at in
posteritatem impendeat.  Sed est tanti, dum modo ista sit privata
calamitas et a rei publicae periculis seiungatur.  Sed tu ut vitiis tuis
commoveare, ut legum poenas pertimescas, ut temporibus rei publicae cedas,
non est postulandum.  Neque enim is es, Catilina, ut te aut pudor umquam a
turpitudine aut metus a periculo aut ratio a furore revocarit.  Quam ob
rem, ut saepe iam dixi, proficiscere ac, si mihi inimico, ut praedicas,
tuo conflare vis invidiam, recta perge in exilium; vix feram sermones
hominum, si id feceris, vix molem istius invidiae, si in exilium iussu
consulis ieris, sustinebo.  Sin autem servire meae laudi et gloriae mavis,
egredere cum inportuna sceleratorum manu, confer te ad Manlium, concita
perditos cives, secerne te a bonis, infer patriae bellum, exsulta impio
latrocinio, ut a me non eiectus ad alienos, sed invitatus ad tuos isse
videaris.  Quamquam quid ego te invitem, a quo iam sciam esse praemissos,
qui tibi ad Forum Aurelium praestolarentur armati, cui iam sciam pactam et
constitutam cum Manlio diem, a quo etiam aquilam illam argenteam, quam
tibi ac tuis omnibus confido perniciosam ac funestam futuram, cui domi
tuae sacrarium [scelerum tuorum] constitutum fuit, sciam esse praemissam?
Tu ut illa carere diutius possis, quam venerari ad caedem proficiscens
solebas, a cuius altaribus saepe istam impiam dexteram ad necem civium
transtulisti?  Ibis tandem aliquando, quo te iam pridem ista tua cupiditas
effrenata ac furiosa rapiebat; neque enim tibi haec res adfert dolorem,
sed quandam incredibilem voluptatem.  Ad hanc te amentiam natura peperit,
voluntas exercuit, fortuna servavit.  Numquam tu non modo otium, sed ne
bellum quidem nisi nefarium concupisti.  Nactus es ex perditis atque ab
omni non modo fortuna, verum etiam spe derelictis conflatam inproborum
manum.  Hic tu qua laetitia perfruere, quibus gaudiis exultabis, quanta in
voluptate bacchabere, cum in tanto numero tuorum neque audies virum bonum
quemquam neque videbis! Ad huius vitae studium meditati illi sunt, qui
feruntur, labores tui, iacere humi non solum ad obsidendum stuprum, verum
etiam ad facinus obeundum, vigilare non solum insidiantem somno maritorum,
verum etiam bonis otiosorum.  Habes, ubi ostentes tuam illam praeclaram
patientiam famis, frigoris, inopiae rerum omnium, quibus te brevi tempore
confectum esse senties.  Tantum profeci tum, cum te a consulatu reppuli,
ut exsul potius temptare quam consul vexare rem publicam posses, atque ut
id, quod esset a te scelerate susceptum, latrocinium potius quam bellum
nominaretur.

Nunc, ut a me, patres conscripti, quandam prope iustam patriae
querimoniam detester ac deprecer, percipite, quaeso, diligenter, quae
dicam, et ea penitus animis vestris mentibusque mandate.  Etenim, si mecum
patria, quae mihi vita mea multo est carior, si cuncta Italia, si omnis
res publica loquatur:  `M. Tulli, quid agis?  Tune eum, quem esse hostem
comperisti, quem ducem belli futurum vides, quem expectari imperatorem in
castris hostium sentis, auctorem sceleris, principem coniurationis,
evocatorem servorum et civium perditorum, exire patiere, ut abs te non
emissus ex urbe, sed immissus in urbem esse videatur?  Nonne hunc in
vincla duci, non ad mortem rapi, non summo supplicio mactari imperabis?
Quid tandem te impedit?  mosne maiorum?  At persaepe etiam privati in hac
re publica perniciosos cives morte multarunt.  An leges, quae de civium
Romanorum supplicio rogatae sunt?  At numquam in hac urbe, qui a re
publica defecerunt, civium iura tenuerunt.  An invidiam posteritatis
times?  Praeclaram vero populo Romano refers gratiam, qui te, hominem per
te cognitum nulla commendatione maiorum tam mature ad summum imperium per
omnis honorum gradus extulit, si propter invidiam aut alicuius periculi
metum salutem civium tuorum neglegis.  Sed, si quis est invidiae metus,
non est vehementius severitatis ac fortitudinis invidia quam inertiae ac
nequitiae pertimescenda.  An, cum bello vastabitur Italia, vestabuntur
urbes, tecta ardebunt tum te non existumas invidiae incendio
conflagraturum?' His ego sanctissimis rei publicae vocibus et eorum
hominum, qui hoc idem sentiunt, mentibus pauca respondebo.  Ego si hoc
optimum factu iudicarem, patres conscripti, Catilinam morte multari, unius
usuram horae gladiatori isti ad vivendum non dedissem.  Etenim si summi
viri et clarissimi cives saturnini et Gracchorum et Flacci et superiorum
complurium sanguine non modo se non contaminarunt, sed etiam honestarunt,
certe verendum mihi non erat, ne quid hoc parricida civium interfecto
invidiae [mihi] in posteritatem redundaret.  Quodsi ea mihi maxime
inpenderet tamen hoc animo fui semper, ut invidiam virtute partam gloriam,
non invidiam putarem.  Quamquam non nulli sunt in hoc ordine, qui aut ea,
quae inminent non videant aut ea, quae vident, dissimulent; qui spem
Catilinae mollibus sententiis aluerunt coniurationemque nascentem non
credendo corroboraverunt; quorum auctoritate multi non solum improbi,
verum etiam inperiti, si in hunc animadvertissem, crudeliter et regie
factum esse dicerent.  Nunc intellego, si iste, quo intendit, in Manliana
castra pervenerit, neminem tam stultum fore, qui non videat coniurationem
esse factam neminem tam improbum, qui non fateatur.  Hoc autem uno
interfecto intellego hanc rei publicae pestem paulisper reprimi, non in
perpetuum comprimi posse.  Quodsi se eiecerit secumque suos eduxerit et
eodem ceteros undique collectos naufragos adgregarit, extinguetur atque
delebitur non modo haec tam adulta rei publicae pestis, verum etiam stirps
ac semen malorum omnium.  Etenim iam diu, patres conscripti, in his
periculis coniurationis insidiisque versamur, sed nescio quo pacto omnium
scelerum ac veteris furoris et audaciae maturitas in nostri consulatus
tempus erupit.  Quodsi ex tanto latrocinio iste unus tolletur, videbimur
fortasse ad breve quoddam tempus cura et metu esse relevati, periculum
autem residebit et erit inclusum penitus in venis atque in visceribus rei
publicae.  Ut saepe homines aegri morbo gravi cum aestu febrique
iactantur, si aquam gelidam biberunt, primo relevari videntur, deinde
multo gravius vehementiusque adflictantur, sic hic morbus, qui est in re
publica, relevatus istius poena vehementius reliquis vivis ingravescet.
Quare secedant inprobi, secernant se a bonis, unum in locum congregentur,
muro denique, [id] quod saepe iam dixi, secernantur a nobis; desinant
insidiari domi suae consuli, circumstare tribunal praetoris urbani,
obsidere cum gladiis curiam, malleolos et faces ad inflammandam urbem
comparare; sit denique inscriptum in fronte unius cuiusque, quid de re
publica sentiat.  Polliceor hoc vobis, patres conscripti, tantam in nobis
consulibus fore diligentiam, tantam in vobis auctoritatem, tantam in
equitibus Romanis virtutem, tantam in omnibus bonis consensionem, ut
Catilinae profectione omnia patefacta, inlustrata, oppressa, vindicata
esse videatis.

Hisce ominibus, Catilina, cum summa rei publicae salute, cum tua peste
ac pernicie cumque eorum exitio, qui se tecum omni scelere parricidioque
iunxerunt, proficiscere ad impium bellum ac nefarium.  Tu, Iuppiter, qui
isdem quibus haec urbs auspiciis a Romulo es constitutus, quem Statorem
huius urbis atque imperii vere nominamus, hunc et huius socios a tuis
[aris] ceterisque templis, a tectis urbis ac moenibus, a vita fortunisque
civium [omnium] arcebis et homines bonorum inimicos, hostis patriae,
latrones Italiae scelerum foedere inter se ac nefaria societate coniunctos
aeternis suppliciis vivos mortuosque mactabis.
